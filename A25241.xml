            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

As I cannot but in way of thankfulneſs acknowledge thus much; So I ſhall be a ſincere Remembrancer both of your Honour, and Your neareſt Relations at the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have now compoſed this Work, containing a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary practice and high priviledge of every Chriſtian; it is by way of ſupplement to the other duties ſet down in my Book call'd <hi>Media,</hi> but becauſe of my large handling it, I reſerved it for a tract by it ſelf. Indeed of all other duties, I prefer it as the chief, and I exceedingly wonder that before this time, it hath not been underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſome abler hand. Chriſtians ordinarily go to Prayer, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Hearing, Reading, and Meditation of the Word; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (though more ſeldom) they ſet on the exerciſe of other Duties, as ſelf-trial, ſelf-denial, the improving of experiences, the clearing of evidences, extemporary and deliberate meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the mean time how is the main, the prime employment, even the duty of duties, <hi>of Looking unto Jeſus,</hi> wholly neglected? If many, or moſt have been ignorant of it hitherto, I think it is high time, to diſcover it to the ſleepy world; and it may be when day is clear, they will walk in the light, and bleſs God for finding out a way, wherein they may more immediately have commerce with Jeſus Chriſt. I could have wiſhed that others more able had appeared in this ſervice, in
<pb facs="tcp:94897:3"/> a particular handling of this excellent ſubject, I find it in print wiſht for by a godly Brother, where he complains that <hi>Chriſt's love had been ſo little ſtudied. Men have been very ſwift in ſearching after other truths, but ſlow in ſearching after this, An ample ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act diſcovery of this love of Chriſt, I ſay of this love (in carrying on our ſouls ſalvation from firſt to laſt) may well be ſet down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the</hi> deſiderata, <hi>the deſirables of Divines, it having been ſo little handled (unleſs in ſome parts or pieces) by any: Surely it is very ſad to think, that the knowledge of this love of Chriſt (in a continued</hi> ſeries) <hi>being of ſuch neceſſary and high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been ſo little enquired into. O what a gallant Goſpel-deſign were it for ſome one who is acquainted with the Spirit in a large meaſure, to go over the whole Hiſtory of the Goſpel</hi> (of the everlaſting Goſpel of Jeſus) <hi>and to obſerve the glorious ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the love of Chriſt to Believers in all!</hi> it would be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous if ſome would take it in hand, and <hi>perfect it to the purpoſe, but it is ſad to think it hath been neglected ſo long.</hi> As the Lord hath enabled, I have adventured; and if for my raſhneſs in not waiting any longer, to ſee if any Star of a greater magnitude would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, I muſt be cenſured, I fly to your Honour for Patronage. Nor only for Patronage, but I humbly heg of You, and Yours, to peruſe and practiſe this ſlender Work; who can tell but ſome of the golden Oile of Grace may come out of Jeſus Chriſt the true Olive-tree, even through theſe Pipes? and if ſo, your own experiences will be ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory anſwers to all other cenſures. Sure I am in this exerciſe (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the directions may be weak) you will find the advantage of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the well-head, and ſo you may drink more ſweetly than others that make uſe only of the ſtreams. That you (my noble Lord) and your vertuous Lady, with your hopeful Iſſue, may receive ſpiritual good by this Treatiſe, and all other helps which God's good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may put into your hands.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt all the duties I formerly mentioned, I omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one that now I look upon as chief and choice of all the reſt: This is the duty I call <hi>Looking unto Jeſus,</hi> and if I muſt diſcover the occaſion of my falling on it, I ſhall do it truly and plainly, and in the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, as thus. In the Spring 1653. I was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with a ſore ſickneſs, and as the Lord began to reſtore my health, it came into my thoughts what my Jeſus had done for my ſoul, and what he was doing, and what he would do for it, till he ſaved it to the uttermoſt. In my conceptions of theſe things I could find no begining of his actings, but in that eternity before the world was made; nor could I find any end of his actings, but in that eternity after the world ſhould be unmade; only betwixt theſe two extremities I apprehended various tranſactions of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, both paſt, and preſent, and to come. In the multitude of theſe thoughts Within me, my ſoul exceedingly delighted it ſelf, and that delight ſtirring up in me other affections (for one affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction cannot be alone) I began to conſider of thoſe texts in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſeemed at firſt to impoſe the working of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on ſo bleſſed an Object, as a Goſpel-duty: then I reſolved, if the Lord Jeſus would but reſtore my health, and prolong my life, I would endeavour to diſcover more of this Goſpel-duty, than ever yet I knew: and that my pains therein might not hinder my other neceſſary labours, my purpoſe was to fall on this ſubject in my ordinary preaching, wherein I might have occaſion both to ſearch into Scriptures, ſeveral Authors, and my own heart. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time I began this work, begging of God that he would help me to finiſh, as he inclined me to begin, and that all might tend to his glory, and the Churches good. In the progreſs of my labours I found a world of ſpiritual comfort, both in reſpect of the object that I handled, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in reſpect of the act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſted my duty to him, in <hi>Looking unto Jeſus.</hi> 1. For the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it was the very ſubject whereon more eſpecially I was bound
<pb facs="tcp:94897:4"/> to preach; <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Coloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)</hi> and he immediately adds, <hi>whom we preach,</hi> Col. 1.27, 28. and <hi>unto me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all the Saints, is this grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> what grace? <hi>that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 3.8. Miniſters ought in duty more abundantly to preach Jeſus Chriſt. Doctor <hi>Sibbs</hi> is clear, that the <hi>ſpecial office of the miniſtry of Chriſt is to lay open Chriſt, to hold up the tapiſtry, &amp; to unfold the hidden miſteries of Chriſt:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorts that <hi>we ſhould labour to be alwayes ſpeaking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what about Chriſt, or tending that way: when we ſpeak of the law, let it drive us to Chriſt: when of moral duties, let them teach us to walk worthy of Chriſt: Chriſt, or ſome what tending to Chriſt, ſhould be our theme, and mark to aime at.</hi> Sibbs Cantic. p. 428. And I may feelingly ſay, it is the ſweeteſt ſubject that ever was Preached on; is it not <hi>as an ointment poured forth,</hi> whoſe ſmell is ſo fragrant, and whoſe ſavour is ſo ſweet, that <hi>therefore all the Virgins love him?</hi> is it not comprehenſive of all glory, beauty, excellency, whether of things in Heaven, or of things on Earth? is it not a myſtery ſweet and deep? ſurely Volumes are written of Jeſus Chriſt, there is line upon line, Sermon upon Sermon, Book upon Book, and Tome upon Tome, and yet ſuch is the myſtery (as one ſpeaks plainly) that we are all but as yet at the firſt ſide of the ſingle Catechiſm of Jeſus Chriſt: yea, <hi>Solomon</hi> was but at <hi>What is his Name?</hi> and I fear many of us know neither Name nor thing. It is a worthy ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make further and further diſcoveries of this bleſſed Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and it were to be wiſhed, that all the Miniſters of Chriſt would ſpend themſelves in the ſpelling, and reading, and underſtanding of it. Look as ſome great point doth require the abilities of many Scholars (and all little enough when joyned together) to make a good diſcovery thereof; ſuch is this high point, this holy, ſacred, glorious Myſtery, worthy of the pains of all the Learned; and if they would all bring their notes together, and add all their ſtudies together (which I have in ſome meaſure endeavoured in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe) they ſhould find ſtill but a little of this Myſtery known, in compariſon of what remains and is unknown; only this they ſhould know, <hi>Quod difficily intellectu, dilectabile inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu</hi> (as <hi>Bernad</hi> ſaid) <hi>That which is hard to underſtand, is delightful to be dived into;</hi> and ſo I found it. 2. For the act of <hi>looking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus,</hi> as it is comprehenſive of <hi>knowing, deſiring, hoping, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, loving,</hi> ſo alſo of <hi>joying;</hi> how then ſhould I but be filled with joy unſpeakable and glorious, whilſt I was ſtudying, writing,
<pb facs="tcp:94897:4"/> and eſpecially acting my Soul in the exerciſe of this <hi>Looking?</hi> If there be any Duty on Earth reſembling the Duty of the Saints in Heaven, I dare ſay, this is it. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in his Epiſtle to Chriſt dying, writeth thus, <hi>An act of living in Chriſt, and on Chriſt, in the acts of ſeeing, enjoying, embracing, loving, reſting on him, is that noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Divinity, and Theology of Beatifical Viſion: there is a general aſſembly of immediately illuminated Divines round about the Throne, who ſtudy, lecture, preach, praiſe Chriſt night and day: Oh what rays, what irradiations and dartings of intellectual fruition, beholding, enjoying, living in him, and fervour of loving, come from that face, that God-viſage of the Lord</hi> God <hi>Almighty, and of the Lamb that is in the midſt of them? And, Oh what reflections, and reachings forth of intellectual Viſion, embracing, loving, wondering, are returning back to him again in a circle of Glory?</hi> Now if this be the Saints Duty, who are perfect in glory; do not we imitate them, and feel ſomething of Heaven in our imitation, in our <hi>looking alſo unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?</hi> I write what in ſome meaſure I have felt; and of which I hope to feel yet more; and therefore whoever thou art that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, I beſeech thee, come, warm thy heart at this bleſſed fire! O come, and ſmell the precious ointments of Jeſus Chriſt! O come, <hi>and ſit down under his ſhadow with great delight!</hi> Oh that all men (eſpecially into whoſe hands this Book ſhall come) would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fall upon the practice of this Goſpel-art of <hi>looking unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus!</hi> if herein they find nothing of Heaven, my skill will fail me; only let them pray, that as they <hi>look to him,</hi> ſo vertue may go out of him, and fill their ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> One thing more I have to ſay to thee; if thou wouldeſt know how to carry on this Duty conſtantly, as thou doſt thy morning, and thy evening prayer; it were not amiſs if every day, either morning, or evening, thou wouldſt take ſome part of it at one time, and ſome part of it at another time, at leaſt for ſome ſpace of time together. I know ſome, that in a conſtant daily courſe carry on in ſecret thoſe two neceſſary duties of <hi>meditation and prayer;</hi> what the ſubject matter of their meditation is, I am not very certain; only our experience can tell us, that be it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or be it hell; be it ſin, or be it grace, or be it what it will; if we be in exerciſe of the ſelf-ſame ſubject either conſtantly, or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, we are apt to grow remiſs, or cold, or formal; and the reaſon is, one thing tires quickly, unleſs that one be all: now that is Chriſt, for <hi>He is All,</hi> Col. 3.11. if then but once a day thou wouldſt make this <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> thy ſubject to <hi>know, conſider, deſire, hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb facs="tcp:94897:5"/> joy in, call upon, and conform unto,</hi> in his ſeveral reſpects of plotting, promiſing, performing thy redemption in his Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Seſſion, Interceſſion, and coming again; and that one of theſe particulars might be thy one dayes exerciſe, and ſo every day thou wouldeſt proceed from firſt to laſt, in thus <hi>looking unto Jeſus,</hi> I ſuppoſe thou wouldſt never tire thy ſelf; and why ſo? O there is variety in this matter to be looked unto, and there is variety in the manner of looking on it. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> one day thou mightſt act thy <hi>knowing of Jeſus</hi> in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the great work of thy ſalvation in his Eternity; the next day thou mighteſt <hi>conſider Jeſus</hi> in that reſpect; and the next day thou mightſt <hi>deſire after Jeſus</hi> in that reſpect; and the next day thou <hi>mightſt hope in Jeſus</hi> in that reſpect; and ſo on, till thou comeſt to the laſt day of the work; which (beſides<note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe, the Reader will, at leaſt, once read over the whole book; and then for this conſtant day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe, during eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one dayes in a year, I leave the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in every period to be read, or not read, as he pleaſeth; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it may, in whole, or in part, conduce any thing to that one act of <hi>knowing Jeſus</hi> in ſuch or ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</note> the object handled at large in every period, in theſe very actings upon the object) would in all amount to the number of eighty one dayes. Now would not this variety delight? It is the obſervation of Mr. <hi>Lockyer,</hi> on <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. that <hi>an holy ſoul cannot tire it ſelf in the contemplation of Jeſus:</hi> how much leſs can it tire it ſelf in <hi>Looking unto Jeſus,</hi> which is far more Comprehenſive than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating of Jeſus? come, try this Duty, and be conſtant in it at leaſt for eighty one days in one year, &amp; ſo for eighty one days in every year during thy life; and then for thy meditations on any other ſubject I ſhall not take thee quite off, but leave the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the year, which is above three parts more, to thy own choice. If thou art ſo reſolved, I ſhall ſay no more, but the Lord be with thee, and if ſooner or later thou findeſt any benefit by this work, give God the glory, and remember him, in thy prayers, who hath took this pains for Chriſt's honour, and thy ſouls good. So reſts</p>

               <p>In the Text we have the act and Object; the act in the Original is very emphatical, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; the Engliſh doth not fully expreſs it; it ſignifies an averting, or drawing off the eye from one object to another; there are two expreſſions, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; the one ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a turning of the eye from all other objects; the other a faſt fixing of the eye upon ſuch an object, and only upon ſuch. So it is both <hi>a looking off,</hi> and <hi>a looking on.</hi> On what? That is the object, <hi>a looking unto</hi> Jeſus; a Title that denotes his mercy and bounty, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> denotes his office and function. I ſhall not be ſo curious as to enquire why <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and not <hi>Chriſt</hi> is nominated; I ſuppoſe the perſon is aimed at which implies them both; only this may be obſerved, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the pureſt Goſpel Name of all other names; <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not the dialect of the Old Teſtament; the firſt place that ever we read of this title as given to Chriſt, it is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21.<note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name</hi> Jeſus, <hi>for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> Some obſerve that this Name Jeſus was given him twice; once till death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. and afterwards for ever, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. the firſt was a note of his entering into Covenant with God to fulfill the Law for us, &amp; to die for our ſins, the ſecond was a note of ſo meritorious a perſon, who for his humility was more exalted than any perſon ever hath been, or ſhall be. Firſt, Jeſus was the humble name of his deſerving grace: now Jeſus is the exalted name of his tranſcendent glory: at firſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> did Crucifie Jeſus, and his name; &amp; the Apoſtle did then diſtruſt whether Jeſus <hi>was the true</hi> Jeſus; but now God hath raiſed him from the dead,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.21. Phil. 2.9.10.</note> &amp; hath <hi>highly exalted him, &amp; given him a name above every name, that at the Name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.</hi> My meaning is not to inſiſt on this Name in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to any other names of Chriſt; he is often called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> and <hi>Son of God,</hi> and <hi>Emmanuel;</hi> Why Jeſus is all theſe; Jeſus is Chriſt, as he is the annointed of God; and Jeſus is <hi>Lord,</hi> as he hath dominion over all the world; and Jeſus is <hi>Mediatour,</hi> as he is the reconciler of God &amp; man; and Jeſus is <hi>the Son of God,</hi> as he was eternally begotten before all worlds; and Jeſus is <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> as he was incarnate, and ſo God with us. Only becauſe Jeſus ſignifie <hi>Saviour,</hi> and this name was given him upon that very account, <hi>For he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins;</hi> I ſhall make this my deſigne to look at Jeſus more eſpecially, as carrying on the great work of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from firſt to the laſt.

                  <p>ONe word of Exhortation. Chriſtians! I beſeech you <hi>look off</hi> all other things, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially all evil things. I know I am pleading with you for an hard thing; I had need of the Rhetorick of an Angel, to perſwade you to turn your Eyes from off theſe things; nay, if I had, all were too little, <hi>it is God only muſt perſwade Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem;</hi> and yet let me offer a few conſiderations, venture at a perſwading of you,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.17.</note> and leave the iſſue with God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, that all other evil things are in Gods account as very nothing; <hi>verily, every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity;</hi> not only man, but <hi>every man;</hi>

O wonder, wonder! and yet 'tis no ſuch wonder, but one day you ſhall find the experience of this truth your ſelves. <hi>Rich men have ſlept their ſleeps, and none of the men of might have found their hands.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 76.5.</note> or as others render it, <hi>they have found nothing in their hands;</hi> that is, rich men have paſſed over this life as men do paſs over a ſleep, imagining themſelves to have golden mountains and rocks of diamond; but when they awake at the day of death, they find themſelves to have nothing.

                  <p n="4">4. Conſider that Chriſt looked off heaven and heavenly things for you, how much more ſhould you look off the earth and earthly things, the world and worldly things for him? Chriſt left the glory, the company, the pleaſures of Paradiſe for you, and <hi>he made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> he nothing'd himſelf (as it were) for you; <hi>you know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Conſider that the rational ſoul of man is oft too high a birth to ſpend its ſtrength upon other things? the ſoul of man is of the ſame nature with Angels; it is a kind of divine ſpark; now if a man have a golden mill, he would not uſe it to grind dirt, ſtraws, and rotten ſticks in; the ſoul, the mind, the thinking faculty of man is too high to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the things of this earth; the ſoul is of a moſt excellent capacious nature, it is fit to converſe not only with Angels, but with the eternal God himſelf, with Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; it is of a tranſcendent being; put all the world into the ballance with it, and it is nothing in compariſon: the ſoul of the meaneſt gally-ſlave is more precious than heaven and earth, than Sun, and Moon, and ſtars, and all the hoaſt of heaven; now if a mans ſoul be of ſuch an high-born nature, if the Lord hath put ſuch a ſpirit into the boſome of man, for him to beſtow the ſtrength of it upon low, baſe, mean, and earthly things, Oh what an evil is this?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Conſider how ſhort is the time that you have here in this world: this is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.29.31.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe the time is ſhort, therefore let us uſe the world as if we uſed it not,</hi> therefore let our hearts be taken off theſe things; yet a few days, and you ſhall be here no more; time paſſeth on, many hundred diſeaſes are ready to aſſault you; you that are reading, hearing, talking or walking, you muſt very ſhortly be carried on mens ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; laid in the duſt, and there left to the worms in darkneſs &amp; corruption; you are almoſt there already; it is but a few days, or months, or years, and what is that when once thy are gone and paſt? and Oh <hi>what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and then loſe his ſoule?</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. STudy every day more &amp; more the vanity of the creature: Read over the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> well; it is enough, through the aſſiſtance of Chriſt, to teach you that leſſon. A ſerious and fruitful meditation of that word, <hi>Vanity of vanities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2.2.</note> 
                     <hi>ſaith the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity,</hi> what work might it make in your hearts; men uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look on theſe things through ſome falſe glaſs, or at a diſtance, which makes them ſo admire them; but if they could ſee them truly in themſelves, oh how uncomely would they be? or if they could ſee them as compared to Chriſt, oh how vain would they be? honours and greatneſs in that reſpect would appear as bubbles, pleaſures and delights in that reſpect would appear as ſhadows.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Converſe but a little with any evil thing on this ſide Chriſt; Have as little to do with the world, the ſinful pleaſures, profits, riches, manners of it, as poſſibly you can; the leſſer the better; things of this world have a glutinous quality, if you let the heart lie any while amongſt them, it will cleave unto them, and if it once cleave to them, there will be no way but either Repentance or Hell fire muſt part them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be more and better acquainted with Jeſus Chriſt; get nearer to him, be more in communion with him, get more taſtes of Chriſt and heaven, and earth will reliſh the worſe for them. Oh when I look on Chriſt, and conſider, that he that was the Lord of heaven and earth, put himſelf into ſo poor and low a condition, meerly for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of his Elect, how ſhould this but deaden my heart to the world?<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>I account all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi> If Chriſt be in view, all the world then is but dung, and droſs, and loſs in compariſon; the Glory of Chriſt will darken all other things in the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Set before you the examples of ſuch Saints, who accounted themſelves pilgrims and ſtrangers upon earth. The Apoſtle gives you a Catalogue of ſuch, who <hi>confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth,</hi> and ſee how they are uſed,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.12.37.38.</note> 
                     <hi>they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword, they wandred about in ſheep-skins and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented;</hi> who were theſe? they were they <hi>of whom the world was not worthy.</hi> Oh when you read, or hear how joyfully theſe ſervants of the moſt high went through their wilderneſs condition, methinks this ſhould take off your hearts from earthly things.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Go in your meditations to heaven, and keep there a while; the mind that is in heaven cannot attend theſe earthly things; would a man leave his plough &amp; harveſt in the field to run with children a hunting after butter-flies? no more will a ſoul that is taking a ſurvey of heaven and heavenly things, fix his eyes on ſuch poor things below: <hi>non vacat exiguis, &amp;c.</hi> is the character of a truly prudent man; the children of that Kingdom above have no while for trifles, and eſpecially when they are imployed in the affairs of the Kingdom.

                  <p>Firſt, for ocular viſion, there may be ſome uſe of that in heaven, for there we ſhall <hi>look on</hi> Jeſus; <hi>with theſe eyes ſhall I behold him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for mental viſion, or the inward eye, that is it that will take up our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and that is it which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in his prayers for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>

It is the ſight of the mind that gives light and vigour to the ſight of the eye, take away the inward light, and the light of the external ſenſe is but as darkneſs and death. 3. It is the ſight of the mind that looks into the worth, uſe, &amp;c. propriety of any thing preſented; the eye can ſee a thing, but not the worth of it; a beaſt looks on gold as well as a man, but the ſight and knowledge of the worth of it is by the internal light of the mind, ſo the eye can ſee a thing but not the uſe of it; a child looks on a tool in the hand of a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but the ſight and knowledge of the uſe of it, is only by a man of reaſon that hath internal light to judge of it: and ſo the eye can ſee a thing, but not the propriety of it; a beaſt looks on his paſture, but he likes it not becauſe it is his, but becauſe it is a paſture, and well furniſhed.

                  <p>Again, this mental <hi>looking</hi> is either notional and theoretical; or practical and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental; the firſt we call barely <hi>the look of our minds;</hi> it is an enlightning of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings with ſome meaſure of ſpeculative ſight in ſpiritual and heavenly myſteries: the ſecond we call <hi>the look of our minds and hearts,</hi> whereby we not only ſee ſpiritual things, but we are<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. For the Object, you muſt <hi>look on Jeſus.</hi>] It is the bleſſed'ſt Object that the eye of the mind can poſſibly fix upon; of all Objects under Heaven, <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in perfection, and he ſhould have the preheminence in our Meditation.

                     <hi>he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> I will not deny, but that the work of ſalvation is common to all the three perſons of the Trinity; it is a known rule,<note place="margin">Opera trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ad extra ſunt indiviſa.</note> 
                     <hi>all outward actions are equally common to the three perſons;</hi> for as they are all one in Nature and Will, ſo muſt they be alſo one in Operation; the Father ſaveth, the Son ſaveth, and the holy Ghoſt ſaveth; yet we muſt diſtinguiſh them in the manner of ſaving; the Father ſaveth by the Son, the Son ſaveth by paying the ranſom and price of our ſalvation, the holy Ghoſt ſaveth by a particular applying of that ranſom unto men: Now whereas the Son pays the price of our redemption, and not the Father, nor the holy Ghoſt, therefore in this ſpecial reſpect he is called our Saviour, our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and none but he.</p>
                  <p>This object, though contained in a word, is very comprehenſive; herein is ſet forth to our view, the offices of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the two Natures of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the qualities of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the excellencies of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> O what variety of ſweet matter is in <hi>Jeſus?</hi> he hath in him <hi>all the powders of the merchants;</hi> an holy ſoul cannot tyre it ſelf in viewing <hi>Jeſus;</hi>

O where ſhall we begin in this view of Jeſus? <hi>Who ſhall declare his Generation? or who ſhall count and reckon his Age?</hi> All the Evangeliſts exhibit unto us <hi>the Saviour,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I need not much to explain the Point, you ſee here is an Ordinance, or a <hi>Goſpel-duty</hi> held forth; many other <hi>Duties</hi> we have elſewhere deſcribed, but this we have kept for this place; and the rather for that this is a choice <hi>Duty,</hi> a compounded <hi>Duty,</hi> an high <hi>Goſpel-ordinance.</hi> No queſtion but <hi>Watchfulneſs, Self-trial, Self-denial, Experiences, Evidences, Meditation, Life of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> do well in their place and order; yet as oars in a boat, (though it be carried with the tyde) may help it to go faſter; it is <hi>Jeſus lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, (as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent)</hi> which ſtrikes more ſoundly into the beholder, than any other way. <hi>Looking unto</hi> Jeſus, is that great Ordinance appointed by God for our moſt eſpecial good. How many ſouls have buſied themſelves in the uſe of other means, and though in them <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath communicated ſome vertue to them, yet becauſe they did not trade more with him, they had little in compariſon? ſuch a one as deals immediately with <hi>Chriſt</hi> will do more in a day, than another in a year, and therefore I call it <hi>a choice, a compleat, a complicate, an high Goſpel-Ordinance.</hi> Now what this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is, the Text tells you, it is <hi>a Looking unto</hi> Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Object; and <hi>Jeſus</hi>

It is ſuch a <hi>look</hi> as ſtirs up affections in the heart, and the effects thereof in our life; it is ſuch a <hi>look</hi> as leaves a quickening and enlivening upon the ſpirit; it is ſuch a <hi>look</hi> as works us into a warm affection, raiſed reſolution, an holy and upright converſation. Briefly, it is an inward, experimental <hi>Looking unto Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For confirmation of the point; this was the Lords charge to the Gentiles of old, <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the ends of the Earth.— And I ſaid, behold me, behold me, unto a Nation that was not called by my Name.</hi> And according to this command was their practiſe; <hi>Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, and they looked unto him and were lightened, and their faces were not aſhamed.</hi>— Thus in the Goſpel, after this command, <hi>Looking unto Jeſus,</hi> it follows, <hi>Conſider him that hath endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf.</hi> And according to this command is the practiſe of Goſpel-believers,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3 18.</note> 
                     <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Inſtead of the vail of Moſaical figures, God hath now given to his Church the clear glaſs of the Goſpel; and hence all believers under the Goſpel do by contemplative Faith, behold <hi>Chriſt,</hi> together with the glorious light of his mercy, truth, goodneſs, and the reſt of his Divine Attributes; and by means thereof they are made like unto him in the glory of Holineſs, and in newneſs of life.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons why we are thus to <hi>Look unto</hi> Jeſus, will be as ſo many motives, which we ſhall reſerve to an uſe of Exhortation; but the reaſons why this <hi>Looking unto Jeſus,</hi> is, 1. An Ordinance. 2. An Ordinance of Chriſt, may be theſe. —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why an Ordinance? here is only this reaſon, the will of the Lord: <hi>Even ſo father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> Ordinances are certain impoſitions ſet forth by an external mandate of a Lawgiver, having Authority to command. It is the will of Chriſt to impoſe this Law on all the ſons of men, that they ſhould <hi>Look up unto him;</hi> and concerning this, what have we to do to enquire into the reaſon? it is our Duty to obey, and not to know of him why he commands; if <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was enough in

                     <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his School, to put the buſineſs paſt diſputing amongſt his Scholars, I am ſure it ſhould be much more in Chriſts School; we will therefore enquire no further reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why an Ordinance of Chriſt? it is this; becauſe all ſpiritual Ordinances, Laws, Inſtitutions, do hold on Chriſt; it is not in the liberty of man to erect any new ſpiritual Ordinance in the Church of Chriſt. I will not deny, but the power of man may come in to order ſuch things, as are not proper, but rather common to the Church with other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, as to meet together in ſome place, and at ſome time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to that rule, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order;</hi> for this is not an inſtitution,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.42.</note> but only the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of right reaſon. But when it comes up to an Ordinance, Law, Inſtitution, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> when ſomething more ſhall be put on the thing, than nature hath put on it, when by vertue of the inſtitution, there is conjoyned to it ſome kind of ſpiritual efficacy to work upon the ſoul, this only holds on Chriſt. Hence, becauſe in the preaching of the Word, and in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments we expect a vertue, a ſpiritual efficacy, more than they have or can yeild in any natural way, therefore we ſay, theſe are <hi>Ordinances of Chriſt;</hi> &amp; ſo becauſe in <hi>Looking unto Jeſus,</hi> we expect a vertue, a ſpiritual efficacy, to go along together with it, more than nature can give it; therefore we call this an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and an <hi>Ordinance of Chriſt,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from all other Ordinances, Rules, Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of men whatſoever.</p>

For the ungodly, <hi>not God, nor Chriſt is in all their thoughts.</hi> Alas!<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.4.</note> they never heard of ſuch a <hi>Duty</hi> as this; they cannot tell what it means, to <hi>Look unto Jeſus.</hi> Nor ſpeak I only of poor Indians, and other Savages of the unchriſtian world, whoſe ſouls are over cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the blackeſt miſts of irreligion, that the Prince of darkneſs can poſſibly inwrap them in, who came into the world, not knowing wherefore; and go out of the world, not knowing whither, an heavie caſe, which cannot ſufficiently be bewailed with tears of blood; But I ſpeak of ſuch as live with in the Paradiſe of the Chriſtian Church, that have nothing to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe Indian miſcreants, but an outward conformity, outward formalities, the charity of others, and their own ſlight imaginations; why alas! theſe are they that the Lord complains of, that they have eyes, and ſee not;<note place="margin">Jer. 2 32.</note> 
                     <hi>My people have forgotten me dayes without number,</hi> they have negligently ſuffered me to be out of their minds, and that for a long time. You will ſay, is there any ſuch here? Can I tax any of you, that you ſhould not <hi>Look up to Jeſus?</hi> are not your eyes towards Chriſt in your prayers, praiſe, ſoliloquies, publick and private Duties? Nay, are not you now in <hi>the Duty,</hi> whileſt I am ſpeaking, and you hearing?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, however you may deem that you do this or that; yet God reckons it as a thing not done in theſe reſpects. —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When it's not done to purpoſe; as if our <hi>looking to Chriſt</hi> makes us not like Chriſt; a man may give a thouſand glances every day towards Chriſt, yet if there be no effectual impreſſion upon the heart, Chriſt takes it as if he had never looked towards him at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When it's done unwillingly. Sometimes men think of Chriſt, but they know not how to ſhun it; the Lord breaks in upon their ſpirits whether they will or no, whereas their own temper is to follow, &amp; to purſue other objects: thus you drop into our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies out of cuſtome, or faſhion, or for ſome ſiniſter end, and here is Chriſt lifted up upon the pole, he is diſcovered in his beauties, graces, ſweetneſſes, excellencies; but when you ſee him, you ſay, <hi>he hath no forme nor comlineſs;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When it's not done according to the rule; <hi>this is not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20.</note> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Corinthians;</hi> no queſtion they did eat it, but becauſe it was not done after its due manner, he ſaith, <hi>this is not to eat the Lords Supper.</hi> Many think of Chriſt, and <hi>Look up to Jeſus,</hi> but becauſe their thoughts are not holy, awful and ſubjecting to the Spirit, in no way proportionable to the goodneſs and glory of the Son of God, they look looſely, careleſly, and carnally upon him, he therefore reckons it as not done: this is not to <hi>Look unto Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94897:13"/>4. When a man makes it not his courſe and trade to <hi>look unto Jeſus.</hi> A man may come unto a Carpenters houſe, &amp; take up his tools, &amp; do ſomthing at his work, but this makes him not a Carpenter, becauſe it is not his trade. The beſt Saints ſin; yet becauſe it is not their trade and courſe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.18</note> they are ſaid, not to ſin: <hi>whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not.</hi> And ſo ungodly men may look, and muſe, and meditate, and think of Chriſt; but becauſe this is not their courſe and trade, they make it not their work to look to Chriſt, they are therefore ſaid, <hi>not to look to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why now conſider, you that plead that you are Chriſtians, &amp; that you mind Chriſt at this very inſtant, that you are in the <hi>duty,</hi> even whilſt I am ſpeaking of it, and yet you neither do it to purpoſe, nor willingly, nor according to rule, nor as it is your trade; is it not with you,<note place="margin">Matth 7.22</note> as it is with them of whom Chriſt ſpake; <hi>many will ſay to me at that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in they name? and in thy name have caſt out devils? and in thy name have done many wonderful works?</hi> they will plead at the laſt day, as you plead now; but for all that, you know the anſwer, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ 23</note> Surely Chriſt will ſay to you one day, <hi>I know you not, I was a ſtranger to you upon earth; I could not have an eye from you, but when your lazie idle ſpirits pleaſed: and now out of my ſight, I'le never own you, nor look upon you more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="1">1. In not ſending out their underſtandings, in not pointing their minds towards Jeſus. <hi>I write unto you</hi> (ſaid the Apoſtle) <hi>to ſtir up your pure minds, by way of remembrance;</hi> it is in the Original <gap reason="foreign">

See how <hi>David</hi> calls upon himſelf, <hi>Awake my glory!</hi> and ſee how <hi>Deborah</hi> calls upon her ſelf, <hi>Awake, awake Deborah, awake, awake, utter a ſong.

                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 64.7</note> 
                     <hi>to take hold of God.</hi> O what a ſhame is this? is it fit that our underſtandings, which God hath entruſted us withal, ſhould be no more improved? is it fit that our minds (thoſe golden cabinets which God hath given us, to be filled with heavenly treaſure) ſhould either be empty, or ſtuft with vanity, nothing, worſe then nothing? O that ſuch glorious creatures as our ſouls, ſhould lacquey after every creature, which ſhould be in attendance upon Chriſt, which ſhould be like Angels, waiting and ſtanding in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our God! O that ſuch glorious things as our immortal ſpirits, ſhould run after vanity, and ſo become vain; which if rightly improved, ſhould walk with Angels, ſhould lodge themſelves in the boſom of the glorious <hi>God!</hi> Do we not ſee how <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſending out to us continually? the thoughts of his heart are love, eternal love? and ſhall not we ſend out our thoughts towards him? ſhall not we let our minds run out towards him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In not bending of their minds to this work. It may be the mind looks up, but it's ſo feeble, that like an arrow ſhot from a bow weakly bent, it reacheth not the mark. It is the wiſe mans counſel,<note place="margin">Eccl. 9.10</note> 
                     <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all they might.</hi> O that Gods people ſhould be ſo lazie, dull, ſluggiſh, ſloathfull in this ſpiritual work! As <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid to the multitudes concerning <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt 11.7</note> 
                     <hi>What went ye out into the wilderneſs to ſee?</hi> So may I ask believers in their <hi>looking unto Jeſus,</hi> What went ye out to ſee? when you crawle, &amp; move, as if you had no hearts nor ſpirits within you, whom go ye forth to ſee? what,<note place="margin">Heb. 1 3.</note> him that is the Lord of glory? what, him that is <hi>the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon?</hi> what, are ſuch heavy &amp; lazy aſpects fit to take in ſuch a glory as this is? you ſee in what large ſtreams your thoughts fly forth to other things. &amp; are you only languiſhing, weak, and feeble, in things of ſo great concernment? Oh that Chriſtians ſhould be cold in ſpirituals, &amp; hot in the purſuit of earthly temporal things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In not binding of their minds to this object, in not ſtaying the eye on Jeſus Chriſt. Some may give a glance at Chriſt, but they are preſently wheeled off again: but why doth not the eye abide there, at leaſt, till it come to ſome profitable iſſue? is not Chriſt worthy on whom our ſouls ſhould dwell? Certainly if we love our Jeſus, that love will hold us; Chriſt then will be in our thoughts, and minds, and we cannot off him: as the load-ſtone having drawn the iron, it keeps it faſt to it ſelf; ſo if love draw our hearts, it holds it faſt to the object loved. Chriſt himſelf acknowledgeth ſuch an operation of love upon himſelf, <hi>Turn away thine eyes, for they have overcome me;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94897:13"/> thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, with one of thine eyes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 6.5.</note> Chriſt was held in the galleries, and captivated with love to his people, ſo that his eyes was ever upon them; nay he could not get his eyes off them, <hi>Can a mother forget her child?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 49.14.</note> 
                     <hi>no more can I forget you;</hi> and is Chriſt ſo tender in his love towards us, that he ever minds us, and ſhall our minds be ſo looſe to him? ſo fluttering, and fleeting? ſhall there be no more care to bind our ſelves in cords of love to him, who hath bound himſelf in ſuch cords of love to us?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In not dayly exerciſing this bleſſed <hi>Duty;</hi> it may be now and then they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, and they get up into heaven to ſee their Jeſus, but it is not dayly. Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider! Is this now and then going to heaven within the vail, to live the life of friends? is this to carry our ſelves as children? what, to be ſo ſtrange at home? but now and then, once in a month, in a year, there to be ſeldom, where we ſhould always be? is Jeſus Chriſt ſuch a mean thing, that a viſit now and then ſhould ſerve the turn? the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> hearing <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom, Oh ſaid ſhe,<note place="margin">1 King 10.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that always ſtand before thee, and hear thy wiſdom;</hi> if ſhe were ſo taken with <hi>Solomon,</hi> remember that a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> is here; and ſhall we deprive our ſelves of that bleſſedneſs, which we might enjoy by ſtanding always in the preſence of Chriſt, to hear his Wiſdom, and to behold his Glory?</p>
                  <p>Oh my Brethren, let us take ſhame to our ſelves, that to this day we have been ſo careleſs in ſending, bending, binding our minds to this bleſſed object, Jeſus Chriſt; yea, let us bluſh that we have not made it our daily buſineſs.<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.2.</note> 
                     <hi>David deſcribes</hi> the <hi>bleſſed man</hi> by his <hi>delighting in the law of the Lord,</hi> and by his <hi>meditating on that Law day and night;</hi> how then is he to be reproved, that neither meditates on the Law of the Lord, nor on the Lord, the Law-maker, <hi>day and night?</hi> O alas! we keep not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe, we are not daily in the exerciſe of viewing Jeſus; nay, I fear, we look upon this <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>looking unto Jeſus,</hi> as a queſtionable thing; it ſeems to many as a <hi>Duty</hi> unknown, unheard of, unthought of, it is not in their notice, and how ſhould it be in their practice?

Epheſ. 2.1.</note> Chriſt lives not in that ſoul, it is a dead ſoul, <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes.</hi> As the dead ſee nothing of all that ſweet and glorious light which the Sun caſts forth upon them, ſo the dead in ſin have no comfortable apprehenſion of Chriſt, though he ſhine in the Goſpel more gloriouſly than the Sun at noon. And as <hi>the dead know not any thing;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ 9 5</note> ſo the dead in ſin know nothing at all of the wiſdom of Chriſt guiding them, or of the holineſs of Chriſt ſanctifying them, or of the fulneſs of Chriſt ſatisfying them, or of the death of Chriſt mortifying their luſts, or of the reſurrection of Chriſt quickning their ſouls, or of the dominion of Chriſt reigning in their hearts. O what a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is this!</p>
                  <p>All this you may ſay is true to a Chriſtleſs ſoul; but what evil to him that may have a title to Chriſt, and yet minds not Chriſt, makes not uſe of Chriſt, doth not <hi>look unto Jeſus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such a caſe I confeſs may be; yea, as many <hi>Duties</hi> are neglected by ſome godly, ſo this main <hi>Duty</hi> is (I may tremble to think it) exceedingly neglected. But, O the ſin, and ſadneſs of thoſe ſouls! O the wants attending ſuch poor creatures! Conſider them in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They have not that wiſdom, knowledge, diſcerning of Chriſt, as otherwiſe they might have. By <hi>looking,</hi> and ſerious obſerving of Chriſt, we gain more, and more knowledge of Chriſt; but if we will not <hi>look,</hi> how ſhould we underſtand thoſe great myſteries of grace? nor ſpeak I only of ſpeculative knowledge, but more eſpecially of practical and experimental; without <hi>looking on Chriſt,</hi> we cannot expect that vertue ſhould go out of Chriſt; there is but a poor character or cognizance of Chriſt upon them that are ſuch; they have not ſo clear, and comfortable, and inward, and experimental a knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They do not ſo taſte the goodneſs of Chriſt, as otherwiſe they might; Chriſt is no other unto them, whilſt neglected by them, but as an eclipſed Star, with whoſe light they are not at all affected; Chriſt is not ſweet to them in his Ordinances, they find not in them that delight and refreſhment, that comfort and contentment, which they uſually miniſter: they cannot ſay of Chriſt as the Spouſe did, <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2.3.</note> they are in the caſe of <hi>Barzillai, who could not taſte what he did eat, or what he did drink; nor could hear any more the voice of ſinging-men, or of ſinging-women:</hi> ſo they cannot taſte the things of God, nor hear the ſpiritual melody which Chriſt makes to the ſouls of them that <hi>look up to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have not that love to Chriſt, which Chriſts beholders have; they medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate not upon Chriſt, as lovers on their love; they delight not themſelves in Chriſt, as the rich man in his treaſure, and the bride in the bridegroom, which they love; their thoughts are rather on the world than Chriſt; their palates are ſo diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they have no pleaſure in the choyceſt wine, they cannot ſay that their ſouls long after him; and no wonder, for how ſhould they love Chriſt, who turn their eyes from him who is <hi>the faireſt of ten thouſands</hi> to other objects? Surely they have no flaming, burning love to Chriſt, that will give every baſe thing a kind of prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:94897:15"/>4. They have not that ſenſe of Chriſts love, which thoſe that exerciſe this <hi>Duty</hi> have; whileſt the ſoul neglects Chriſt, it cannot poſſibly diſcern the love of Chriſt; it perceives not Chriſt applying the Doctrines of his love to the conſcience: Chriſt appears not in his banquetting houſe, he enables not the ſoul to pray with confidence, he makes it not joyful in the houſe of prayer. And hence it is, that ſuch ſouls move ſo ſlowly in Gods ſervice; they are juſt like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> charrets, without wheels; O they perceive not the Love of Chriſt, either in the clear revelation of his ſecrets, or in the free communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his graces, or in the ſanctifying and ſweetning of their tryals, or in ſealing up the pardon of their ſins: O they feel not thoſe raviſhing comforts, which uſually Chriſt ſpeaks to the heart, when he ſpeaks from his heart in love. O the want! O the miſery of this want!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They have not that experience of the power of Chriſt, which they have that are in the exerciſe of this <hi>Duty.</hi> Would you know wherein lies the power of Chriſt? I anſwer, in caſting down the ſtrong holds of ſin, in overthrowing Satan, in humbling mens hearts, in ſanctifying their ſouls, in purifying their conſciences, in bringing their thoughts to the obedience of Chriſt, in making them able to endure afflictions, in cauſing them to grow and encreaſe in all Heavenly graces; and this power they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, who rightly and experimentally <hi>look</hi> up to Chriſt. But if this <hi>Duty</hi> be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is no ſuch thing; hence we call this, <hi>the Duty of Duties, the chief Duty, the eſpecial Duty;</hi> and for all other <hi>Duties, Means, Ordinances,</hi> if Chriſt be not in them, they are nothing worth; In every <hi>Duty</hi> this is the eſſential part, that we <hi>look</hi> through all, <hi>unto</hi> Jeſus; it is only from Chriſt, that Vertue and Efficacy is communicate in ſpiritual Ordinances; there were many people in a throng about Chriſt, but the infirm woman that touched him, was ſhe alone that felt efficacy come from him; we ſee many attend the Ordinances, frequent the Aſſemblies, but ſome few only find the inward power of Chriſt derived unto their ſouls. They that neglect, or are groſly ignorant of this great miſtery of <hi>looking unto</hi> Jeſus, are no beter then ſtrangers to the power of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They have not that ſenſe of the worth and excellency of Chriſt, that are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this <hi>Duty;</hi> they are not ſo raviſhed with his Beauty, they are not ſo taken with the Sweetneſs and Pleaſantneſs of the Face of Chriſt; he is not the faireſt of ten thouſands in their eyes; and hence it is, that they do not take pleaſure, long after, delight or joy themſelves in Chriſt: indeed theſe affections are the Evidences of our high eſteem; they that rejoyce not in Chriſt, nor have any longings after Chriſt, they put a very unworthy price upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They have not that ſenſe either of their own wants, or of the worlds vanity, who are not in the practice of this <hi>Duty.</hi> In this glaſs we ſee that man is blind, and no Sun but Chriſt can Enlighten him; that man is naked, and no garment but Chriſt's can cloath him; that man is poor, and no treaſure but Chriſt can make ſatisfaction for him; that man is empty, and none but Chrſt can fill him; that man is diſtreſſed, perplexed, tormented, and none but Chriſt can quiet him. Why? all this, and much more than this appears in this glaſs of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> the ſoul that looks here, cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend an end of all other perfection; yea, the further it looks on the creature, the deeper and deeper vanities it diſcerns. But alas! there is no obſervation, no ſenſe, no feeling either of mans wants, or of the worlds vanity, or of any ſutable good in Chriſt, to them that are not in this Divine and Spiritual contemplation.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of their wants, that neglect this <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>looking unto Jeſus.</hi>

That Chriſt gives grace and holineſs unto them; <hi>of his fulneſs we receive grace for grace.</hi> As the print upon the wax anſwers to the ſeal, or as the characters upon the Son anſwers to the Father; ſo there are certain ſtamps of the grace of Chriſt upon the Saints, that what good they do, it ſprings not from external mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

That Chriſt gives contentation or ſatisfaction unto them: as the pearl ſatisfied the Merchant in the Parable with treaſure, ſo Chriſt ſatisfieth the ſoul with wiſdome in the underſtanding, with the ſenſe of his love in the heart, with ſure and bleſſed peace in the conſcience; they that rightly <hi>look unto Jeſus,</hi> may ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> did,<note place="margin">Luke 2.32</note> 
                     <hi>I have enough.</hi> 4. That Chriſt gives glory unto them; <hi>he is the glory of Iſrael,</hi> he is both the Author, and the matter of their glory; he is the glory of their juſtification, as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the glory of him that wears it; he is the glory of their redemption, as the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer is the glory of the captive: he is the glory of their ſanctification, as <hi>Jordan</hi> clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him from his leproſie was the glory of <hi>Naaman;</hi> he is their <hi>all in all,</hi> in whom they glory, and <hi>to whom they give all honour, and glory, and power, and praiſe.</hi> 5. That Chriſt gives peace unto them, <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf,</hi> he is the Author,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.29 Epheſ. 2.14. Acts. 10.36</note> and the world is the object of this reconciliation. <hi>Chriſt is our peace;</hi> and <hi>peace is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> they that hear Chriſt in the Word, or that <hi>look unto Chriſt</hi> by the eye of faith, they have this peace; for Chriſt only in Ordinances is the revealer, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer, and the worker of peace in all the children of peace. 6. That Chriſt procures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with God for them; he ſtands betwixt God and ſuch believers; and as they mind him, ſo he is ever mindful of them, pleading their cauſe, anſwering all the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, and praying to his Father in their behalf. 7. That Chriſt gives life unto them; <hi>he that hath the Son, hath life;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 5.11.</note> he that hath Chriſt in his heart as a root of life living in him, or as a King ſetting up his throne within him, or as a Bridegroom betroathing himſelf in loving kindneſs to him, <hi>he hath life,</hi> the life of grace, and the earneſt of the life of glory. 8. That Chriſt gives wiſdome unto them, <hi>Chriſt hath in him all the treaſures of wiſdome,</hi> and therefore he that looks moſt to Chriſt is the wiſeſt man in the world; he that hath the Sun, hath more light than he that hath all other lights in the world, and wants the Sun. 9. That Chriſt gives a taſte of his goodneſs unto them; they cannot <hi>look unto him,</hi> but he makes them joyful with the feeling of himſelf and Spirit: and hence it is that many times they brake out into <hi>Pſalms, and Hymnes, and ſpiritual ſongs,</hi>

That Chriſt gives a ſincere and inward love of himſelf unto their hearts. No ſooner is their eye of faith <hi>Looking unto Jeſus,</hi> but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their hearts is all on fire; ſuch a ſutableneſs is betwixt Chriſt and their ſouls, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the hearts of lovers; their love to Chriſt is like the love of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> a wonderful love, and <hi>paſſing the love of women;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.26</note> they love him as the bridegroom to whom their ſouls are married, as the choyceſt pearl by whom they are inriched, as the Sun of conſolation, by whoſe beams their ſouls are comforted, as the fountain by whom their hearts are refreſhed, and their deſires every way ſatisfied. 11. That Chriſt gives the ſenſe of his own love to them; they cannot <hi>look on Chriſt,</hi> but they ſee him loving, and embracing their humble ſouls; they ſee him binding up their broken hearts; they behold him gathering to himſelf, and bearing in the boſom of his love, and comforting with the promiſes of his Word their wounded ſpirits; they behold him like <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerving in the heat and in the cold for <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſerving in manifold afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from his cradle to his croſs, to make a Spouſe unto himſelf. 12. That Chriſt gives the experience of his power to them; they that <hi>look on Chriſt,</hi> do feel the power of Chriſt inwardly in their ſouls, diſſolving the works of Satan, caſting down his Kingdom, and mighty holds within them, healing all their ſpiritual maladies, ſuſtaining them in all afflictions, filling their ſouls with all Spiritual and Heavenly might, making them ſtrong in knowledg, and ſtrong in faith, and ſtrong in love, and ſtrong in motion, and coming to Chriſt, as a river of much waters is ſtrong in coming home to the Ocean. 13. That Chriſt gives the ſenſe of his own worth and excellency unto them, they ſee now in Chriſt is wiſdome ſurpaſſing the brightneſs of the Sun, even all the treaſures of wiſdome; in Chriſt is power excelling the ſtrength of rocks, he is not onely ſtrong, but ſtrength it ſelf; in Chriſt is Honour tranſcending all the Kings of the earth, for he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; in Chriſt is beauty excelling the Roſe of <hi>Sharon,</hi> and Lilly of the valleys, he is fairer than all the flowers of the field, than all the precious ſtones of the earth, than all the lights in the firmament, than all the Saints and Angels in the higheſt heavens. 14. That Chriſt gives the ſenſe of their wants, and of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94897:16"/> the worlds vanity, and of his ſutable goodneſs unto them, In <hi>looking unto Jeſus</hi> they ſee themſelves in themſelves miſerable, and all other things miſerable comforters: they have learnt the meaning of that Pſalm,<note place="margin">Pſal. 146.3, 4.</note>

                     <hi>held in his galleries, his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner over us being love:</hi> hereby we are carried up into the Mount with Chriſt, that we may ſee him (as it were) transfigured, and may ſay with <hi>Peter, Maſter, it is good for us to be here, and let us here build Tabernacles.</hi> Oh it's an happy thing to have Chriſt dwell in our hearts, &amp; for us to lodge in Chriſts boſome! Oh its an happy thing to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a reciprocal communication of affairs betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and our ſouls! as thus; he bare our ſins, take we his healing: he endured wounds for us, drink we the ſpiritual balſom that ſprang out of his wounds; he took upon him our unrighteouſneſs, do we cloath our ſelves with his righteouſneſs: he endured pains for us, come we to him, and take his reſt to our ſouls; he embraced our curſe and condemnation, do we embrace his bleſſing, juſtification, and ſalvation. To this end do we <hi>look on Jeſus,</hi> if he hide his face by deſertions, reſt not till we find him; if we find him, hold him faſt, let him not go, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb him not out of our hearts by our corruptions.

                     <note place="margin">Matth. 6.21.</note> If Chriſt be your Treaſure, your hearts will be on Chriſt; and ſurely an heart ſet upon God in Chriſt is a true evidence of ſaving Grace. External actions are eaſieſt diſcovered, but thoſe of the heart are ſureſt Evidences: when thy learning will be no good proof of thy Grace, when thy arguments from thy tongue and hand may be confuted, yet then will this Argument from the bent of thy heart prove thee ſincere. Take a poor Chriſtian that hath a weak judgment, a failing memory, a ſtammering tongue, yet if his heart be ſet on Chriſt, I had rather die in this mans condition, and have my ſoul in his ſouls caſe, than in the caſe of him without ſuch an heart, though he had the moſt eminent gifts, and parts, and abilities of any in the world.

How may it ſtrengthen your patience in ſufferings to think of Chriſts patience? What, are you ſerved ill?

                  <p n="6">6. Conſider that your Eye on Jeſus will preſerve the vigour of all your Graces. As the body is apt to be changed into the temper of the air it breaths in, and the food it lives on, ſo will your ſpirits receive an alteration according to the Objects which they are exerciſed about. You that complain of deadneſs and dulneſs, that you cannot love Chriſt, nor rejoyce in his loves, that you have no life in Prayer, nor any other Duty, and yet you never tried this quickning courſe, or at leaſt you were careleſs and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in it; what, are not you the cauſe of your own complaints? ſay, <hi>is not your life hid with Chriſt in God?</hi> O whether muſt you go but to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for it?

                  <p n="7">7. Conſider, it's but equal that your hearts ſhould be on Chriſt, when the heart of Chriſt is ſo much on you. Chriſt is our Friend, and in that reſpect he loves us, and bears us in his heart; and ſhall not he be ours? Surely this is ill requital; this is a great contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the law of Friendſhip: But Chriſt is our Lord as well as Friend; and if the Lord of glory can ſtoop ſo low as to ſet his heart on ſinful duſt, one would think we ſhould eaſily be perſwaded to ſet our hearts on Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſtians! do you not perceive that the heart of Chriſt is ſet upon you! and that he is ſtill minding you with tender love, even when you forget both your ſelves and him? Do you not find him following you with daily mercies, moving on your ſouls, providing for your bodies, and preſerving both! doth he not bear you continually in the armes of love, and promiſe that <hi>all ſhall work together for your good?</hi> doth he not give his Angels charge over you, and ſuit all his dealings to your greateſt advantage? and can you find in your hearts to caſt him by? can you forget your Lord, who forgets not you? Fie upon this unkind Ingratitude! When the Lord ſpeaks of his thoughts and reſpects to us, he gives this language, <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking-child,</hi>

At ſuch a time if we forget the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it will argue our diſaffection, our ingratitude, our diſobedience every way.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 139.17.</note> look in what kind ſoever you account a thing precious, ſo precious are the thoughts of God and Chriſt to a man, whoſe heart is in a right frame. Such a one loves every glance of Chriſt, and the more it ſees, the more it loves; It is ſaid of one <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> that he wiſhed he might be admitted to come near the body of the Sun, to have a full view of it, though it devoured him; he was ſomthing raſh in his wiſh: but there is ſomthing proportionable in a godly ſpirit, he ſo loves Chriſt, that he could be content to be ſwallowed up in the beholding of him. Certainly there is a bleſſing in this work; when we are bid to <hi>look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus,</hi> it is but to receive from Jeſus: is it any thing elſe but to call and invite us to look on the moſt pleaſing and delightful object? That in the beholding of it, it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it ſelf unto us, and we be delighted and filled with it? it is all one as if he ſhould bid us ſit down by a well of Life, and drink; or if he ſhould bid us be as the Angels are, who are bleſſed in the beholding of this Jeſus; why come then, if this be a bleſſed work, why will we unbleſs our ſelves? If the work will exalt us, why will we debaſe our ſelves, in not cloſing with it? If we might live above heaven, why will we live below? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when thoughts of Chriſt are moving in us, Chriſt himſelf is not far off, he will come, and enter too; and how ſweet is it for Chriſt to come and take up his habitation in our ſouls.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. By <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is the Object of this Act, we mean <hi>a Saviour, carrying on the great work of mans ſalvation from firſt to laſt;</hi> hence we ſhall follow this method, to look on this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as our <hi>Jeſus</hi> in theſe ſeveral periods. 1. In that Eternity before all time until the Creation. 2. In the Creation the beginning of time until his coming. 3. In his firſt coming, the fulneſs of time until his coming again. 4.

Before I direct you how to look on him in theſe reſpects, I muſt in the firſt place propound the Object: ſtill we muſt lay the colours of this admirable beauty before your eyes, and then tell you the art how you are to <hi>look upon them.</hi>

                  <p>We muſt conſider in God two things, 1. That in God there is an underſtanding. 2. That in God this underſtanding everlaſtingly acts or works.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, that God hath a moſt excellent underſtanding, or that he is underſtanding it ſelf in the higheſt degree, is very clear; for he that gives underſtanding to all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible creatures, muſt needs have it, and be it moſt eminently in himſelf: if fire be the cauſe of heat in other things, it muſt needs be, that fire is the hotteſt of any thing;<note n="*" place="margin">Propter quod unum quodque tale, illud eſt magis tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> the axiome is common, but the Scripture verifies it, <hi>with God is wiſdom and ſtrength, he hath counſel and underſtanding.</hi> Nay, that this underſtanding is his very being is very plain, <hi>Counſel is mine, and ſound wiſdom, I am underſtanding, and I am ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, that this underſtanding in God everlaſtingly acts or works, is very clear; for that underſtanding (which is the nature, eſſence, and being of God) is a meer act, or the firſt act, it is all one with <hi>the life of God;</hi> now as all life is active in it ſelf, ſo the chief life (ſuch as in the higheſt degree is to be attributed to God) muſt needs be active; what is the life of God, but an eſſential property, whereby the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature is in perpetual action, living and moving in it ſelf? and hereof is that ſpeech in Scripture ſo often uſed,<note place="margin">Jer. 4.2 Jer. 38.16 Numb. 14.21 Rom. 14.21</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord liveth;</hi> hereof likewiſe is that aſſeveration or oath ſo often uſed by God, <hi>as the Lord liveth,</hi> and <hi>As I Live ſaith the Lord;</hi> well then, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of God being active, or working from all eternity, it muſt needs have ſome eternal object on which it acts or works; every action requires a ſutable object, about which it muſt act, or be exerciſed: ſo then if Gods underſtanding act eternally, it muſt have ſome eternal object; and if Gods underſtanding act moſt perfectly, it muſt have ſome moſt perfect object to act upon; and what is that but onely God himſelf? that Gods underſtanding ſhould act out of himſelf, would argue his underſtanding to act upon that which is finite and imperfect: Certainly nothing is infinite, eternal, and perfect, but onely himſelf; and therefore if his underſtanding will act upon any ſutable object, he muſt act upon nothing but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And now we come to the manner of this high, myſtical, ſpiritual generation of Jeſus the Son of God. As the underſtanding of God doth act and reflect upon it ſelf from all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94897:19"/> eternity, ſo it works this effect, that it underſtands and conceives it ſelf; it apprehends in the underſtanding an image of that Object which it looks upon, and this very image is the Son of God. This we ſhall lay out by ſome ſimilitudes. A mans ſoul (we know) doth ſometimes muſe and meditate on other things; as it thinks of Heaven, or it thinks of earth; this we call a right or direct, or emanant thought; but ſomtimes the ſoul doth muſe, or meditate on it ſelf, as when it thinks of its own Eſſence, or faculties, or the like; and this we call a reflect thought; why now the ſoul underſtands it ſelf, now it hath ſome Idea, or image of it ſelf, now it conceives it ſelf; this is our phraſe, <hi>it conceives it ſelf.</hi> There is not only a carnal, but a ſpiritual Conception; as when I underſtand this or that, I ſay, <hi>I conceive this or that,</hi> I have the Idea, or image of this or that, within my Soul. Or as in a glaſs, a man doth conceive and get a perfect image of his own face by a way of reflection; ſo God in beholding and minding of himſelf, doth in himſelf beget or conceive a moſt perfect, and a moſt lively image of himſelf, which very image is that in the Trinity which we call the Son of God. Thus you read in Scripture that Jeſus the Son of God is called <hi>the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and the expreſs Image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> 1. <hi>The brightneſs of his Fathers Glory,</hi> herein God the Father is compared unto a lightſom body, and God the Son unto a beam, or ſplendor ſent forth, or iſſuing out from that glorious body. 2. <hi>The expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> herein God the Father is compared unto a ſeal, and God the Son unto an impreſſion reſulting from the ſeal; Now look as wax upon a ſeal, hath the engraven Image of the Seal; ſo the Son of God (which the Father hath begotten or conceived of his own underſtanding) is the very Image of his Fathers underſtanding; hence not only the Father, but alſo the Son is called Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it ſelf. <hi>I have Counſel and Wiſdom,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I am <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 8.14.</note> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Father is, the Son is; indeed the underſtanding in men, and the thing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, are not uſually one and the ſame, but in God it is all one: Gods conceivings and begettings are the moſt inward of all; the Father conceives of himſelf, and in himſelf; and his conceiving is a begetting, and his begetting abideth ſtill in himſelf, becauſe his underſtanding can no where meet with any thing ſuitable, but that which he himſelf is; and that conveying of himſelf, or begetting of himſelf is the ſecond ſubſiſtence in the Trinity, which we call the everlaſting Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the mutual kindneſs and lovingneſs of him that begets, and of him that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, we ſay this brings forth a third perſon or ſubſiſtence in God. Now for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this matter, we muſt conſider two things; firſt, that in the Eſſence of God, beſides his underſtanding there is a Will. Secondly, that this Will doth work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly upon it ſelf, as his Underſtanding doth.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, that in the Eſſence of God, beſides his Underſtanding, there is a Will, is very clear; for he that gives a will to all rational creatures, cannot want it himſelf; how ſhould he be without will, whoſe will it is that we will? of neceſſity it is that there ſhould be ſome prime or chief will, on whoſe will all other wills ſhould depend; but the Scriptures are plain, <hi>I am God, and there is none elſe; I am God, and there is none like me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 46.9, 10.</note> — <hi>My Councel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, that this will in God doth everlaſtingly work upon it ſelf, is clear: for, as doth the underſtanding, ſo doth the will; but the underſtanding of God doth act upon it ſelf as the chief, and moſt perfect Truth, therefore the will of God doth will himſelf as the chief and moſt perfect good. Indeed what other ſutable Object can the will of God have beſides himſelf? an infinite will muſt needs have an infinite good; and in this ſenſe, as our Saviour tells us, <hi>there is none good but one, that is God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 9.17.</note> hence it is that the will of God, doth reflect upon it ſelf, and acquieſs in it ſelf as in an infinite good.</p>
                  <p>And now we come to the manner of this high, myſtical, ſpiritual proceſſion of the Spirit from the Father and the Son. As the Will of God doth act and reflect upon it ſelf from all Eternity; ſo it works this effect, that it delights it ſelf in the infinite good which it knoweth in it ſelf; for the action of the Will is delight and liking; and this very delight which God or his Will hath in his own infinite goodneſs, doth bring forth a third perſon, or Subſiſtence in God, which we call the holy Ghoſt: So that indeed, if you would know what the Holy Ghoſt is, I would anſwer, <hi>it is the mutual kindneſs, and lovingneſs, and joy, and delight of the Father and the Son.</hi> The Father by this act of Will doth joy and delight in his Son, and the Son by this act of Will doth joy and delight in his Father; and this is it which the Son ſaith of himſelf, and of his Father,<note place="margin">Prov. 8 30.</note> 
                     <hi>I was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him,</hi> q. d. I was from all eternity his delight, and he was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94897:20"/> from all Eternity my delight: the Father (as it were) from all Eternity aſpired in his Will, and Love, and joy unto the Son; and the Son (as it were) from all Eternity aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Will, and Love, and joy unto the Father; and from this common deſire and aſpiring of either Perſon the Holy Ghoſt proceeds, which makes up the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>y of perſons.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall lay out this by ſome ſimilitude or reſemblance; As when a man looks in a glaſs, if he ſmile, his image ſmileth too: here's but one face, and yet in this Unity we may find a Trinity: the face is one, the image of the face in a glaſs is another, and the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them both together is a third, and yet all are in one face, and are of one face, and all are but one face; ſo the underſtanding which is in God is one; the reflection, or image or his underſtanding he beholdeth in himſelf as in a glaſs, is a ſecond; and the love and likeing of them both together, by reaſon of the will fulfilled, is a third; and yet all are in one God, and all are but one God. In this Trinity there is neither firſt nor laſt, in reſpect of time, but all are at once, and at one inſtant; even as in a glaſs the face, and the image of the face, when they ſmile, they ſmile together, and not one before, nor after another. — For concluſion of all. As we have the Son of the Father by his everlaſting will in working by his underſtanding; ſo we have the Holy Ghoſt of the love, and joy, and delight of them both, by the joynt working of the underſtanding and will together; whereupon we conclude three diſtinct perſons, or ſubſiſtences, which we call the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, in one ſpiritual, yet unſpeakable ſubſtance, which is very God himſelf. — My meaning is not to inſiſt on the Father, or the holy Ghoſt, but only on the Son. Yet thus far I have added, that you may better underſtand the manner of this generation of the Son of God; together with the mutual kindneſs, lovingneſs, joy, and delight betwixt the Father and the Son, even from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>

                  <p>NOw let us look on Chriſt in his Relation to us before all Worlds. God being thus alone himſelf from everlaſting, and beſides himſelf there being nothing at all, the firſt thing he did (beſides what ye have heard) or the firſt thing he poſſibly and conceivably could do, it was this; <hi>a determination with himſelf, to manifeſt his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> Or, <hi>a purpoſe in himſelf to communicate his glory out of his aloneneſs everlaſting unto ſomewhat elſe:</hi> I ſay <hi>unto ſomewhat elſe,</hi> for what is communication but an efflux, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation, an iſſuing from, or a motion betwixt two Terms? I have now brought you to the acts, or actions of God in reference to his Creatures; follow me a little, and I ſhall anon bring you to Chriſt in relation to your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Theſe acts or actions of God were and are. 1. The Decree. 2. The Execution of the Decree of God. I muſt open theſe Terms.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Decree is an action of God, out of the Councel and purpoſe of his own Will, determining all things, and all the Circumſtances, and order of all things from all Eternity in himſelf certainly, and unchangably, and yet freely, <hi>Who worketh all things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>after the Counſel of his own will;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.11.</note> and this work, or action of God is internal, and for ever abiding within his own Eſſence it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The execution of the Decree is an act of God, whereby God doth effectually work in time all things as they were fore-known and Decreed. And this action of God is external, and by a temporal act paſſing from God to the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Decree, that is of diverſe kinds: As firſt, There is a Decree common and general, which looks to all the creatures; and it is either the Decree of creation, or the Decree of Providence and preſervation. 2. There is a Decree ſpecial, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to reaſonable creatures, Angels, and Men, it is called the Decree of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and it conſiſtss of the Decree of Election and Reprobation. Concerning the common and general Decrees we have but little laid down in Scriptures, and it is little, or nothing at all to our purpoſe; And concerning the ſpecial Decree of Angels, there is not much in Scriptures, and that is as little alſo to our purpoſe; we have only to deal with Men, and with Gods Decree in relation to Mans Salvation before all Worlds.</p>
                  <p>And this we call Predeſtination, or the Decree of Election; which is either of Chriſt,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94897:20"/> or of the Members of <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> Himſelf was firſt Predeſtinated: This appears by that Saying of <hi>God; Behold My Servant whom I uphold,</hi>

Why, One in Will, and One in Power, and One in Nature. 1. One in Will: That appears in the words precedent, concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sheep;<note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>My Father gave them Me,— and I give unto them Eternal Life:</hi> They are both agreed to ſave <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sheep; the <hi>Father</hi> is willing, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is willing: Look how much the Will of the <hi>Father</hi> is in it; ſo much the Will of the <hi>Son</hi> is in it: <hi>For He and the Father are One.</hi> 2. One in Power: That appears likewiſe in the words precedent;<note place="margin">Ver. 28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe Sheep ſhall never periſh,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) neither ſhall any Man pluck them out of My Hand: My Father is Greater than All, and no Man is able to pluck them out of My Father's Hand.</hi> Here is firſt the Power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all in Him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for the Salvation of His Sheep; that, if <hi>he</hi> have any Power in Him, and be able to do any thing, not one of them ſhall Periſh: And <hi>he</hi> gives the Reaſon of the Prevalency of <hi>his</hi> Power, from <hi>his</hi> Father's Power, engaged as much as <hi>his</hi> own in this Buſineſs; they are alike faſt in <hi>his</hi> Hands, and in <hi>his</hi> Father's Hands: <hi>For He and the Father are One.</hi> 3. One in Nature: And of this, I ſuppoſe, are the words more eſpecially underſtood: The <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> are both of one Nature, of one Eſſence, of one Being: And this is not only an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they did both agree, and were like to agree in that Great Tranſaction of ſaving Souls; but that they can never diſagree: Two that eſſentially have Two Wills, though for the preſent agreeing in One; yet they may come to diſagree, and will not the ſame Thing; but if eſſentially they have but One Will, it is impoſſible then but that they ever muſt agree. —So then, the <hi>Father</hi> from Everlaſting calls the <hi>Son</hi> to the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour: [q. d. <hi>Come My Son, the Son of My Joy, and high Delight; My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed: There's a Thought in My Heart to communicate My Self out of this Aloneneſs everlaſting, unto ſome-what elſe; and My Thought, or Purpoſe, or Intention, lies in this Order:</hi> Firſt, <hi>I intend My own Glory, then</hi> Chriſt, <hi>then the Church, then the World; thus is My Providence to diſpoſe every thing ſo much more principally &amp; timely, by how much it is more Excellent: Next to My Glory, &amp; the manifeſtation of it, I will have a</hi> Chriſt; <hi>and this</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſhall be the chief Pattern of the Election of Grace: &amp; next to</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Head, I intend a Body, and this Body I will Predeſtinate to be made like, or to be conformed to the Image of My Son.

                     <hi>Why, Loe I come; in the Volume of the Book, it is written of Me to do Thy Will, O</hi> God: <hi>This is My Mind; yea, and this ſhall be My Mind for ever:</hi>

                     <hi>When I am Incarnate, this ſhall be My Meat, to do the Will of Him that ſent Me, to finiſh His Work. Glorious</hi> Father, <hi>Thy Will is My Will: I ſeek not Mine own Will, (as if I had a Will diſtinct from Thine) but the Will of My Father. Now therefore, I accept this Honour: Be it to Me, or be it with Me, even as Thou pleaſeſt.</hi> This Call of the <hi>Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 8.23.</note> and Anſwer of the <hi>Son,</hi> is fully confirmed by that Saying of <hi>Chriſt; I was ſet up from Everlaſting.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Project</hi> to ſave Souls, is diverſly laid down by <hi>Diſſenting Brethren.</hi> Some give it in thus: 1. That there ſhould be a Mediatour and Redeemer unto Mankind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as fallen in the State of Sin. 2. That all ſuch ſhould be received into Favour, as ſhall Repent, and Believe, and Perſevere unto the End. 3. That ſufficient and neceſſary Means of Grace ſhould be offered and adminiſtred unto all Men without Exception. 4. That certain ſingular Perſons ſhould be ſaved, whom <hi>God</hi> fore-ſaw would Repent, and Believe, and Perſevere. This way is juſtly oppoſed by Others, who deny <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Acts</hi> in Intention, to be in the ſame order as we ſee them in Production: In order of Material Exiſting, it is granted, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Revealed, Promiſed, and Exhibited after Sin; and that we Repent, Believe, Perſevere before we are <hi>Saved:</hi> But in order of <hi>God</hi>'s Intention, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is before Sin, and Salvation before Repentance, Faith, Perſeverance. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> reckoned the Order, in which Things exiſt, thus: 1. <hi>The World.</hi> 2. You, <hi>The Elect.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.22, 23.</note> 4. <hi>God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. But he gives us to underſtand the Order of Intention thus: As <hi>Firſt, God</hi> intends His <hi>own Glory,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then <hi>the Elect,</hi> then <hi>the World.</hi> Certainly, it is an hard thing to marſhal the Eternal, Immanent Acts of the Divine Underſtanding, or Will, into <hi>Firſt, Second, Third, Fourth:</hi> All <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Projects</hi> are like Himſelf,<note place="margin">Tota ſimul &amp; perfecta poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio ſui.</note> who is a <hi>whole and perfect Poſſeſſion of Himſelf together and at once;</hi> ſo as in Him conſidered, there is no <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> nor <hi>Poſterius</hi> in any of His <hi>acts;</hi> but conſidered in Effects, or in reſpect of us, one thing may be ſaid to be <hi>Firſt, Second,</hi> or <hi>Third</hi> in Nature, Time, &amp; Being, before or after another.

                  <p>OF the <hi>Counſels</hi> of <hi>God</hi> concerning Man, before all Worlds, we read in ſeveral Texts. <hi>Chriſt was delivered by the determinate Counſel of</hi> God.—<hi>For of a truth,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.11.</note> And thus the Members of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are ſaid to <hi>Obtain an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, being Predeſtinated according to the Purpoſe of Him, who worketh all Things after the Counſel of His own Will.</hi> Of this <hi>Counſel</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s Will, we know but little now; yet this will be made known, when we come to Glory; yea, it will be a great Part of the Glory of Heaven, for the <hi>Lord</hi> to make known the <hi>Counſel</hi> of His Will; we now know <hi>his Will,</hi> but we ſhall then know the <hi>Counſel of His Will,</hi> &amp; praiſe Him to all Eternity for it. This ſhall be the Glory of the Saints, that they ſhall ſee into the <hi>Counſel of God</hi>'s <hi>Will,</hi> in chuſing them, and calling them; and paſſing by others, and letting others go. In the mean-while, thus far we may know; for thus far He hath revealed Himſelf, concerning <hi>His Counſels,</hi> about Man from Everlaſting.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Man ſhould be a Reaſonable Creature; and becauſe that very Creature is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably ſubject to the Creator, (for <hi>He made all things for Himſelf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note> and all is to return that Glory to Him, for which He made them) therefore Man ſhould ſerve Him as all other Creatures muſt; only his Service ſhould be after a reaſonable manner, out of Judgment,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.30. Heb. 11.25, 26.</note> Diſcretion, and Election: Hence <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to <hi>have choſen the Way of Truth;</hi> &amp; <hi>Moſes</hi> to have <hi>Choſen the Afflictions of</hi> God's <hi>People, &amp; the Reproaches of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>before the Pleaſures of Sin, or the Treaſures of</hi> Egypt. And hence it is, that Holineſs, in the Phraſe of Scripture, is called <hi>Judgment; He ſhall convince the world of Judgment;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 16.11. Mat. 12.20.</note> &amp; <hi>he ſhall bring forth Judgment
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94897:22"/> unto Victory;</hi> and hence it is, that our Service is called <hi>a Reaſonable Service. God</hi> would not ſet any ſuch determinating Law over the Operations of Man, as over other Creatures, that ſo he might truly work out of Judgment, and ſtand or fall by his own Election.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if Man ſhould deviate from this Reaſonable Service, and break the Law which <hi>God</hi> would give, and which he himſelf ſhould have an Original Power to perform, that then he ſhould incur the Diſpleaſure of <hi>God;</hi> and ſuch a Curſe, and ſuch a Penalty ſhould be inflicted. And here comes in the Fall of Man into <hi>God</hi>'s Conſideration; He looks upon it as a wilful tranſgreſſion of his Law; and by how much the Law was more juſt, and the obedience more eaſie, by ſo much he judges the tranſgreſſion more unreaſonable, and the puniſhment more certain and intolerable.</p>

                  <p>This is the great Miſtery of the Goſpel; this is that which the Angels (as I tell you) pry into; nay, this is that which the Angels and Saints too ſhall admire, and bleſs God for, to all Eternity; this is that which ſet the infinit <hi>Wiſdome</hi> of God on work from all Eternity.

O the wonder of Heaven and Earth! here's the caſe, man is fallen through ſin, and ever ſince the fall, man and ſin are as inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably joyned together as fire and heat; yet God will have mercy on the man, and he will take vengeance on the ſin; the Eternal <hi>Wiſdome</hi> of God, hath found out a way to tranſlate this mans ſins on another Perſon, who is able to bear them, and to intereſt this mans perſon in anothers Righteouſneſs, which is able to cover him; ſo that now all's one in regard of man, as if the Law had been utterly abrogated; and all's one too, in regard of God, as if the creature had been utterly condemned.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe Election on Faith or Love fore-ſeen, it makes God to chooſe us when we have choſen him, and to love us when we have loved him firſt; but this is contrary to Scripture,<note place="margin">1 John 4.19. Verſe 10.</note> 
                     <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt; —and herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>

                     <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious;</hi> Now to be <hi>gracious,</hi> as is confeſſed, properly imports a propenſeneſs of mind and will to do ſome ſignal good without any motive or engagement thereunto from without, eſpecially from the perſon or perſons to whom this good is done, or intended; which is a plain Argument, that <hi>I will have mercy,</hi> is not of that kind of mercy, the exerciſe whereof is drawn out, or procured by any thing whatſoever in thoſe to whom it is ſhewed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſeth it ſelf, or him in whom it reſideth ſo to do; and in this reſpect <hi>mercy</hi> differs very litle, or nothing at all from grace: the Apoſtle exchanging <hi>Moſes</hi> his words, was but his Interpreter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe Election on Faith fore-ſeen, is all one as to ſay, we are ordained to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life becauſe we believe;<note place="margin">Acts 13.48.</note> but the Scripture ſpeaks contrary, <hi>as many as were ordained to Eternal Life believed,</hi> and not as many as believed were Ordained to Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

Such a falſely named Predeſtination might more truly and properly have been called a Poſt-deſtination.

                  <p>THE Decree of God concerning mans ſalvation before the foundation of the world, appears in theſe texts, <hi>I will declare the decree</hi> (ſaith God); what was that? why, concerning Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſa 2.7, 8</note> and concerning the Church, <hi>thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee; ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> It was <hi>Gods</hi> Decree to give out of Jews and Gentiles a Church to Chriſt; and this Decree was made in that day of eternity, when the Son of <hi>God</hi> was begotten of his Father. This Decree in Scripture-phraſe hath ſeveral titles, 1. It is the very ſame with that which we uſually call <hi>predeſtination;</hi> for what is predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation but a Decree of <hi>God</hi> concerning the different preparations of Grace, whereby ſome are guided infallibly unto ſalvation? predeſtination is a Decree both of the means and end; a Decree of giving Grace, effectual unto ſome perſons here, and of bringing the ſame perſons unto glory hereafter. This Decree, this predeſtination, this golden chain of the means and end,<note place="margin">Rom. 8 30</note> is ſet down by the Apoſtle, <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> As <hi>God</hi> hath predeſtinated ſome to life and glory, ſo he hath predeſtinated them to be called, and juſtified before they be glorified; whomſoever the Lord hath decreed to ſave them hath he alſo decreed to ſanctifie before they come to injoy that ſalvation.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.4</note> 
                     <hi>God have choſen us in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be firſt holy,</hi> and then <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2 13.</note> See how theſe are twiſted by the Apoſtle once and again, <hi>God hath from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth. I</hi> have heard of ſome blaſphemous reaſonings, <hi>if we are predeſtinate to be ſaved, we may live as we liſt; for howſoever we live though never ſo wickedly, yet we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> O fearful! O deviliſh reaſoning! ſurely this comes from the Devil, and not from <hi>God,</hi> or his Word: Mark here one of Satans depths; <hi>in outward things he tempts men to diſtruſt God, and to rely altogether on means: but in heavenly things, and matters of ſalvation, he tempts men to lay all on Gods Decrees and Gods purpoſes, without any regard had to the means.</hi> Such men might as well ſay, the Lord hath appointed that we ſhall live to ſuch a time, and till then we ſhall not die, and therefore what need we food in health, or phyſick in ſickneſs? Oh take heed of theſe reaſonings! Gods Decree doth not remove the uſe of the means, but eſtabliſh and confirm them.—2. The Decree is the ſame with that <hi>book of life</hi> wherein are written the names of the Elect;<note place="margin">Phil. 4 3 Luke 12 20 Rev. 20.12</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of <hi>ſome women, with</hi> Clement, <hi>and other fellow-labourers, whoſe names are in the book of life.</hi> And Chriſt bids his Diſciples <hi>rejoyce, becauſe their names are written in heaven.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion <hi>the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God, and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life.</hi> As Captains have a book wherein they write the names of their Souldiers; and Citizens have a book wherein they record the names of their Burgeſſes; So God hath his Decree or book of life, in which he regiſters all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.32, 33.</note> Some other texts ſpeak of a book of life, as, <hi>blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou haſt written,</hi> ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> in his zeal for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to whom the Lord anſwered <hi>whoſoever ſinneth againſt me, him will I blot out of my book.</hi> But this was not the book (ſay ſome) of Gods eternal Decree, but the book of his providences; God hath a double book, and both in a figure he hath a book of his reſolved Decrees, and a book of his acted providences; this latter is but a tranſcript, or a copy of the former: thoſe huge origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal volumes of love and bleſſings which God hath laid up in his heart for his own people from all eternity is the book I mean: Indeed this book is writing out every day, by the hand and pen of providence in the ordering of all thoſe affairs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſalvation.— 3. This Decree is the very ſame alſo with Gods ſeal; <hi>the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> A ſeal is uſed in three caſes; 1. To keep things diſtinct. 2. To keep things ſecret. 3. To keep things ſafe: In every of theſe reſpects Gods Decrees are ſeals, but eſpecially in the laſt; thoſe ſouls that are ſealed by God, they are ſafe in the love and favour of God; as when <hi>Job</hi> tells us that <hi>God ſealeth up the ſtars, (i.e.)</hi> ſay ſome, he preſerveth the ſtars in their Orbs, in the places where he hath ſet them they ſhall never drop out; ſo God
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94897:24"/> ſeals up his Saints, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> he ſecures them of the eternal love of God, ſo that they ſhall never drop out of his heart. All theſe titles ſpeak the immutability of Gods eternal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent acts; <hi>q. d. I decree, I predeſtinate, I book it, ſeal it, that ſuch and ſuch perſons ſhall be eternally ſaved; and why all this? but to note the certainty, and ſtability of the thing: ſhall great Monarchs of the earth do thus? ſhall they decree, and book, and ſeal, to ſhew their greatneſs, and wiſdom, that they could ſo reſolve, as no perſon or power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould be ſtrong enough to cauſe them to change their reſolutions? and ſhall not I much more? do not I know, or foreſee all that can or will follow? is there any power, or ever ſhall be to take them out of my hands?

Can any thing fall out hereafter to make me more provident, more powerful, more wiſe, more merciful then now I am? it may be in ſome things I may will a change, but can I in any thing truly change my will? no, no, I am the Lord, I change not, therefore ye ſons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49.1, 2, 3, 4. the Prophet ſeems to ſet it Dialogue-wiſe; one expreſſeth it thus; Firſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> begins, and ſhews his commiſſion, telling God how he had called him, and fitted him for the work of redemption, and he would know what reward he ſhould have of him for ſo great an undertaking. <hi>The Lord hath called me from the womb,</hi>

                     <hi>it is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the tribe of</hi> Jacob <hi>and to reſtore the preſerved of</hi> Iſrael: that is not worth the dying for, I value thy ſufferings more than ſo, <hi>I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the ends of the earth.</hi> Methinks I imagine as if I heard God ſpeak unto Chriſt from eternity: <hi>See here I have loved a remnant of mankind both of Jews and Gentiles with an everlaſting love, I know they will ſin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themſelves, and ſo become enemies to me, and liable unto eternal death; now thou art a mighty perſon, able to do what I require of thee for them; if thou wilt take upon thee their nature and ſins, and undertake to ſatisfie my Juſtice and Law, and take away that hatred that is in them towards me and my Law, and make them a believing holy people, then I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, and adopt them in thee for my ſons and daughters, and make them co-heirs with thee of an incorruptible crown of life.</hi> And then ſaid Chriſt, <hi>loe I come to do thy will O God;</hi>

                     <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men; though it be but a mans Covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſanulleth, or addeth thereto. Now to Abraham &amp; his ſeed were the promiſes made; he ſaith not, and to ſeeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt.</hi> There is a queſtion whether this Covenant here mentioned, was made onely betwixt God and Chriſt, or onely betwixt God and us, or both betwixt God and Chriſt, &amp; betwixt God and us. The occaſion of this queſtion is in theſe words, <hi>Now to Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 3.31</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; his ſeed, were the promiſes made; he ſaith not, and to ſeeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy ſeed which is Chriſt.</hi> 1. Some argue hence, that there is no Covenant or promiſe made to us, but only to Chriſt, or with Chriſt; Chriſt ſtood for us, &amp; articled with God for us, and performed the conditions for life and glory; ſo that the promiſes are made all to him: yet this indeed is confeſſed, that becauſe we are Chriſts, and are concerned in the Covenant, it is therefore ſometimes called a Covenant made with us; <hi>I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah;</hi> not that the Covenant is really made with us, but only with Chriſt for us; and when we feel our ſelves under the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94897:26"/> Power of the promiſe, we begin then to know that we are in that ſame Covenant. But this is rather (ſay they) to feel our ſelves in that Covenant which God hath made with Chriſt, than to enter into Covenant with God our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others argue hence, that there is no Covenant or promiſe made with Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, but only with Chriſt myſtical, ſuch who are members of Chriſt, and ſo united to Chriſt; for mark the Text ſay they) <hi>the promiſe is made firſt to Abraham, and then to his ſeed;</hi> this ſeed is ſuch a ſeed as comes to have right to the promiſe in order from <hi>Abraham;</hi> now this cannot be Chriſt perſonal, but Chriſt myſtical: And whereas the Text ſayes, <hi>the promiſe is not made to ſeeds, but to one ſeed, which is Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 8 37 Gal. 37.29</note> they diſtinguiſh of a double ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> Firſt, there is a carnal natural ſeed according to the fleſh, and in this ſenſe Chriſt ſpeaks to thoſe wicked unbelieving Jewes, which went about to kill him. <hi>I know ye are Abrahams ſeed, but ye ſeek to kill me.</hi> Secondly, there is a ſpiritual ſeed that walk in the faith &amp; ſteps of <hi>Abraham; know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham.</hi> And <hi>if ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe;</hi> now the promiſe is made to <hi>Abraham and his ſeed, not ſeeds; (i.e.)</hi> not to both ſeeds, both carnal and ſpiritual, but only to the one, which is the ſpiritual, and this ſeed is Chriſt, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Chriſt myſtical, the body of Chriſt, the faithful that are knit to Chriſt by a true and lively faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others argue hence, that this Covenant is made both betwixt God and Chriſt, and betwixt God and us; Firſt, betwixt God and Chriſt: all the work of redemption and ſalvation was tranſacted betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> before the foundation of the world, but this doth not hinder, but that the ſame promiſe is afterwards in time made to us alſo: Look as it is in Covenants amongſt men, while the child is yet unborn the father takes conveyance of an inheritance for his child, which he keeps in his own hand till the child be born and come to years, and then he puts it into his own poſſeſſion; ſo it is here, we are for a time hid in the womb of Gods Election, till we are brought forth by the grace of regeneration; now during this time we are not in our ſelves capable of receiving any promiſe of life made to us; but it is made to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our behalf, and he receives the promiſe from the Father in our ſtead: but yet ſo that when we come to be born anew, the promiſes are made unto our ſelves, and then we are put into poſſeſſion of them.</p>
                  <p>Here then is the meaning of the Text, <hi>the Covenant is made with Chriſt; (i.e.)</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his heirs; principally with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and with <hi>Abrahams</hi> nature in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet perſonally with believers, who are alſo the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> All the difference is in that terme <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what thereby is meant, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> perſonal, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> myſtical, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> repreſentative: And we ſay—</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94897:27"/> Knowledg we have attained, we muſt ponder, and muſe, and meditate and conſider of him: now conſideration is an expatiating, and enlarging of the mind and heart on this or that ſubject: conſideration is a fixing of our thoughts, a ſtedfaſt bending of our minds to ſome ſpiritual matter, till it work on the affections, and converſation. We may know, and yet be inconſiderate of that we do know; but when the intention of our mind and heart is taken up about ſome one known object, and other things are not for the preſent taken notice of, this is <hi>conſideration.</hi> O that, if it were poſſible, we could ſo conſider Jeſus in this firſt period of eternity, as that for a while at leaſt we could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all other things!

I beſeech you be dead to the world, be inſenſible of all other things, and <hi>look</hi> onely <hi>on Jeſus;</hi> it is ſaid that men in a phrenzy are inſenſible of what you do to them, becauſe their minds are taken up about that which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſo ſtrongly; and if ever there was any object made known to take up the mind of a ſpiritual man, it is this, even this: not but that other objects may be deeply and ſeriouſly minded of men; it is reported of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who was a great Mathematician, that when the City was taken wherein he was, and the warlike inſtruments of death clattering about his ears, and all was in a tumult, yet he was ſo buſie about drawing his lines, that he heard no noiſe, nor did he know there was any danger: but if ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as thoſe could take up the intention of his mind, ſo as not to regard other things, how much more ſhould this conſideration of Chriſt? If a carnal heart, a man that minds earthly things, be ſo taken up about them, becauſe they are an object ſuitable to him, how much more ſhould a gracious heart, that can ſee into the reality of theſe things of God &amp; Chriſt from everlaſting, be ſo taken up with them as to mind nothing elſe? come then, O my ſoul, and ſet thy conſideration on work, as thus.—</p>

This their delight is mentioned next to their delighting in each other. 4. This delight is aforehand, whileſt Gods heart was only in the expectation, and his mind but laying the plot of thy ſalvation, all theſe argue how great a matter this was in Gods eſteem, and how much his heart was in it, even from everlaſting.

                  <p n="2">2. Conſider Jeſus meerly in his relation to us: conſider him in that great tranſaction betwixt God and him for our ſalvation. And that we may ſettle our thoughts, and dwell here,—</p>

                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.6</note> O my ſoul conſider, meditate and muſe on this plot of the Almighty; it is contained by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in a very few words, do thou weigh them all: here is, 1. The <hi>Praiſe.</hi> 2. <hi>The glory.</hi> 3. <hi>Of his Grace.</hi> 1. <hi>Praiſe</hi> is a ſetting forth of this or that, by word, or deed, or geſture; it containes in it reverend reſpect, an high eſteem, a ſtrong admiration. 2. <hi>Glory</hi> is the glorious being, or eſſence of God, the glory of God in himſelf. Sometimes we read of the <hi>glory of his power,</hi> that is, his glorious eſſence which is moſt powerful, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of <hi>the glory of his Majeſty,</hi> that is, his glorious eſſence which is moſt Majeſtical;<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.9 Iſa. 2.16 Epheſ. 1.6.</note> and ſometimes of <hi>the glory of his grace,</hi> that is, his glorious eſſence, which is moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful; but, 3. Why <hi>the glory of his grace?</hi> mercy and grace meet both in love, only they differ thus, mercy is love as it helps the miſerable, and grace is love as it gives good things, freely without deſert; here then is the great deſigne which God from everlaſting carried on, that the glorious eſſence of his free love, free-grace, ſhould be eſpecially manifeſted to his Saints, that ſo thy might admire it, eſteem it, honour it, and ſound forth the praiſes of it. All the other deſignes of God were but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient unto this. Some reckon up three great deſignes of the Almighty communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating himſelf; as 1. The glory of his Saints. 2. The glory of Chriſt. 3. The glory of himſelf, and eſpecially the glory of his grace. 1. That his Saints ſhould be glorious, and to that purpoſe he made heaven and earth, and he makes them Lord of all,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.21 verſ 23. 2 Theſ. 1.10</note> 
                     <hi>all things are yours.</hi> 2. That Chriſt ſhould be glorious, and to that purpoſe he makes the Saints, and gives them to Chriſt, <hi>all things are yours, and you are Chriſts.</hi> And certainly ſaith the Apoſtle, at the laſt day, <hi>Chriſt ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</hi> 3. That God himſelf ſhould be glorified; <hi>he made all things for himſelf. —Bring my ſons from farre, and my daughters from the ends of the earth, even every one that is called by my name, for I have created him for my glory.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16.4 Iſa. 43.6.7.</note> Now this is the high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of God, to which all the reſt are ſubſervient; mark the ſteps, <hi>all things are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods (i.)</hi> For God, and for his glory: the two former deſignes are to which, but not for which God worketh: he that buildeth an houſe, that he may lay a ſure foundation, and that he may raiſe the frame, he gives it the due filling which belongs to it: but theſe are not his proper ends, his main deſigne: but that he may have an houſe for his habitation: So God works, many things to our glory, and that in us Chriſt may be glorious; but the proper end, that high deſigne which he hath in all, it is his own glory. And yet O my ſoul, conſider a little further, the plot of our ſalvation, of the Saints glory, and of Chriſts glory, as it aimes at the glory of God, ſo eſpecially at <hi>the glory of his grace:</hi> As if we ſee that one doth this or that in wiſdom, it is the glory of his wiſdome: if he do it in ſtrength or power, it is the glory of his power: if he do it out of grace, it is the glory of his grace: ſo God deſigned the ſalvation of our ſoules out of his meer grace, favour, love, he muſt needs intend to have his grace notified in us, and to have it (being known) accordingly admired, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and honored by us; not but that God muſt be glorified in his wiſdome, power, juſtice, holineſs, and his other attributes; ay, but eſpecially in this, it is <hi>the grace of God</hi> in which he moſt delighteth, even as vertuous Kings affect, above all their other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to be had in honour for their clemency, and bounty. So it is with our God the King of Kings, Lord of Lords; all he doth is to this end, that his grace may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to his greater glory. And to this end is the glory of Chriſt, and the glory of Chriſtians referred. Why Lord, that this ſhould be thy plot, <hi>to ſave my ſoul, that my ſoul ſhould praiſe the glory of thy grace?</hi> that thy grace ſhould before all worlds think on me for good? O how ſhould I but think on thee, and thy free-grace? How ſhould I but admire it, adore it, praiſe it, exalted it above Sun and Moon, and Starres? how ſhould I but cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>Oh the depth of the riches of thy grace! for of him,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">v rſ. 26.</note> nay, ſee it repeated, <hi>to declare I ſay his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus:</hi> not that he might be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, but that he might be juſt in juſtifying him that believeth in Jeſus. This Text <hi>Luther</hi> had a great deal ado to underſtand, and he prayed much, before he could get the right meaning of it.</p>
                  <p>This is the great myſtery of the Goſpel; no wonder if a poor man could not reach it: This is that which ſet the infinite wiſdome of God on work from all eternity, how to find a way to ſave ſinners, and to be infinitely righteous notwithſtanding. — Nay, yet O my ſoul conſider, a little further; not only is the mercy of God in this way glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, but the glory of his juſtice is as much, yea more then if the ſinner were eternally damned: — It is made good thus.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When God appointed a ſurety, his Son, and charged our debts upon him to ſatisfie his juſtice: in that God would not ſpare his Son the leaſt farthing token, I mean, not the leaſt degree of puniſhment; hereby the Lord ſhewes a ſtronger love to juſtice then if he had damned ten thouſand, thouſand creatures. Suppoſe a Malefactor comes before a Judge, the Judg will not ſpare the Malefactor, but commands ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Law; this ſhewes that the Judge loves juſtice: but if the Judges own Son be a delinquent, and it appears before all the Country, that the Judge will not ſpare him, the Judge now doth more honour juſtice in this, than in condemning a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand others: So when the Lord ſhall caſt many thouſands to Hell there to be tormented for ever, and ever, and ever, this ſhewes that God loves juſtice; but when his own Son ſhall take our ſins upon him, and God will not ſpare him, (that is the very word in the Scripture,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32</note> 
                     <hi>he ſpared not his own Son</hi>) this, ſurely this declares Gods love to righteouſneſs more than if all the World ſhould be Damned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſe the ſinner that is reconciled had been Damned, then the juſtice of God had been but in ſatisfying, and never had been fully ſatisfyed: but in that way that God hath found out to ſave a ſinner, his juſtice is not onely ſatisfying, but it comes fully to be ſatisfied, to have enough. As for inſtance; ſuppoſe a man to be a creditor to one, who owes him 100000 l. this man is poor, and the utmoſt he can pay is but a penny a day; ſuppoſe the creditor ſhould lay him in the Goale until he had paid the utmoſt farthing, it is true he would be receiving day after day, but he would never be paid ſo long as the debtor lives; now if another rich man ſhould come, and lay down an 100000 l. at once, the creditor is preſently ſatisfied. Why here is the difference betwixt Gods ſatisfying his Juſtice upon ſinners, and upon Jeſus Chriſt; God comes upon the ſinner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the debt of puniſhment, becauſe he did not pay the debt of obedience: God caſts him into Priſon, and the utmoſt he can pay, is but (as it were) a penny a day; and hence the poor ſinner muſt ſtill be paying, and paying, and paying to Eternity: this is the ground of their Eternal puniſhment in Hell, becauſe in any finite time they can never pay enough: But now comes <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and he fully payes the debt at once, ſo that juſtice ſaith, <hi>I have enough, I am ſatisfied:</hi> Surely this is the greater Glory to the very juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the counſels of God from all Eternity, how he ſhould make way for his love and goodneſs, and yet ſatisfie his Truth and Juſtice. O my ſoul, conſider and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! Jeſus Chriſt was the Expedient, and in Chriſt not only Gods mercy, but his juſtice is Exalted, yea more Exalted, and more Glorified in thy ſalvation, then ever it could have been in thy Damnation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Conſider the fore-knowledge of God; he knew from everlaſting whom he would ſet apart for life and ſalvation. All the Saints of God from firſt to laſt, they were then preſent to him, and before him, and he did look on them in his Beloved Chriſt. Before there was a World, or a man, or any creature in it, he fore-knew <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Patriarchs, and all the Prophets, and all the Apoſtles, &amp; all the Diſciples of Chriſt, and Believers in Chriſt; And O my ſoul, if thou art one of Gods Elect, he foreknew thee with a knowledge of love and approbation, he had thee in his Eye,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.11</note> and Heart: he had thoughts on <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was <hi>yet unborn, and had done

                  <p>O muſe, and meditate, and ponder on this love! it contains in it theſe particulars: as, 1. The eternal good will of God: what elſe is the love of God towards the Elect, but his everlaſting good will to ſhew them mercy, to do them good, and to ſave their ſouls? hence the Angels ſung that Antheam at Chriſts birth, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt,</hi>

                     <hi>and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> 2. The Eternal pleaſure and delight of God in the ſons of men; the greateſt delight that God hath, or ever had, it is in communicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Son firſtly, and next unto his Saints: nay, ſuch delight he takes in letting out his mercy to his Saints: as that he was well-pleaſed with the death of his own Son, as a means conducing thereunto. O wonderfull! one would think that the death of Chriſt ſhould be the moſt abhorring to the heart of God of any thing in the world, and yet ſaith the Scripture, <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10</note> he took a pleaſure and delight in the very bruiſing of Jeſus Chriſt: the Lord ſaw this was the way for him to communicate himſelf in the fulneſs of his grace unto his Saints, and therefore though it coſt him ſo dear as the death of his own Son, yet he was well-pleaſed with it. 3. This love of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it a fore-knowledg and approbation of all thoſe effects of his love, whether they be temporal concerning this life, or Eternal concerning the life to come. Concerning theſe effects of his love, ſaith <hi>John,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="1">1. We muſt deſire after the manifeſtation of this work in us. We have heard of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, excellent, glorious things done by Jeſus Chriſt for his Saints from all Eternity; &amp; oh what deſires now ſhould be in us to know that we are of that number? when I hear and conſider that there was ſuch a project, and ſuch counſels, and ſuch love, and ſuch a purpoſe, and ſuch decrees, and ſuch a Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſouls; and withal, that they are but few in compariſon concerning whom <hi>God</hi> and Chriſt hath all this care, will not this whet on my deſires? and make me cry, and cry again, <hi>Oh that theſe loves were mine! how happy were I, if I had a ſhare in theſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thoughts of God?</hi> Methinks we ſhould not hear of ſuch tranſactions, but it ſhould ſtir up our hearts in infinite deſires; methinks we ſhould pant after aſſurance, and ſtill be wiſhing, <hi>Oh what is truth? and what is Chriſt? and what did Chriſt for me before I was, or before the World was?

Tell me, you that have took a full view of God &amp; Chriſt, and of all theſe wonders of Eternity: do you not ſenſibly differ from your ſelves in your affections? Is not the world, worldly pleaſures, worldly profits, and worldly honours fallen too; yea, ten in an hundred with you? have they not loſt their price? would you not rather be aſſured that <hi>your names are written in the Book of Life,</hi> then to have all the world yours; yea, and all the Devils in Hell ſubject to your commands?

                  <p n="1">1. We engage our ſelves by promiſe one to another.

Thou mayeſt find a thouſand promiſes ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered here and there in the book of God; and all theſe promiſes are a draught of that promiſe which was made from all Eternity, and therefore it is ſo much the more ſure; it is as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, <hi>wilt thou have engagement by promiſe? this is paſt long agoe; my Father hath engaged himſelf to me before the World began; yea, and I have made many, and many a promiſe, ſince the World began? Read in the Volume, and thou wilt find here and there a Promiſe, here and there a draught of the firſt Copy of that great Promiſe, which my Father made unto me from all Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we would make things ſure to one another, we write it down; And ſo will I, ſaith God: thou haſt the Scripture, the Holy Writ, thoſe Sacred Volumes of Truth and Life, and therein thou haſt the golden Lines of many gracious Promiſes; are they not as the Stars in the Firmament of the Scripture? thou haſt my Bible, and in the Bible thou haſt many bleſſed glorious Truths: but of all the Bible, methinks thou ſhouldſt not part with one of thoſe promiſes, no, not for a World. <hi>Luther</hi> obſerving the many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes writ down in Scripture, expreſſeth thus, <hi>the whole Scripture doth eſpecially aim at this, that we ſhould not doubt, but hope, confide, believe, that God is Merciful, Kind, Patient, and hath a purpoſe and a delight to ſave our ſouls.</hi>

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:94897:33"/>5. When we would make things ſure to one another, we take an oath. And ſo will I, ſaith God:<note place="margin">He. 6.17.</note> 
                     <hi>God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his counſel, confirmed it by an oath, q. d.</hi> there is no ſuch need of an oath, but I will be abundant to thee, becauſe I would have thee truſt me, and confide in me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and as I ſwear (ſaith <hi>God</hi>) ſo will I ſwear the greateſt Oath that ever was, <hi>I ſwear by my ſelf:</hi> God ſwears <hi>by God: he could ſwear by no greater, and therefore he ſwear by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> and why thus, but for their ſakes who are the heirs of promiſe?<note place="margin">Heb. 6.13.</note> 
                     <hi>he knows our frame, and members, that we are but duſt;</hi> and therefore to ſuccour our weakneſs, the Lord is pleaſed to ſwear, and to confirm all by his Oath.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When we would make things ſure to one another, we take a pawn. And I will give thee a pawn ſaith <hi>God:</hi> and ſuch a pawn, as if thou never hadſt any thing more, thou ſhouldeſt be happy: it is the pawn of my Spirit. <hi>Who alſo hath ſealed us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.22.</note> 
                     <hi>and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts, q. d.</hi> I will ſend my Spirit into your hearts, and this Spirit ſhall be a pawn, an earneſt in your hearts, of all the good that I intend to do for you for ever.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When we would make things ſure to one another, ſomething it may be is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, as an ingagement of all that which is to come. And thus will I deal with thee, ſaith <hi>God,</hi> who liveſt in theſe laſt of times: why thou ſeeſt the greateſt part of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation already done, I made a promiſe from all Eternity of ſending my Son into the World to be made a curſe for ſin; yea, and if thou believeſt, for thy ſin; and this is the greateſt work of all that is to be done to all Eternity. Surely, if I would have failed thee in any thing, it ſhould have been in this; it is not ſo much for me now, to bring thee to Heaven, to ſave thy Soul, as it was to ſend my Son into the World to be made a curſe for ſin: but when I have done ſo great a work, &amp; have been already faithful in that Promiſe, how ſhouldſt thou but believe my faithfulneſs in making good all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? If a man ſhould owe thee a thouſand pound, and pay thee nine hundred, nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and nine, thou wouldſt think ſurely, he would never break for the reſt; why God hath paid his nine hundred, ninety, and nine; and all the Glory of Heaven is but as one in compariſon of what he hath done; we may therefore well believe, that he who hath done ſo much for us, will not leave the little undone.</p>
                  <p>Come then, rouſe up O my Soul, and believe thy intereſt in thoſe eternal tranſactions betwixt God and Chriſt: is not here ground enough for thy Faith? if thou art but <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> the promiſe of God is thine: or if thou dareſt not rely on this promiſe (which God forbid) thou haſt his Indenture, his Seal and Witneſſes of all ſorts, both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; or yet, if thou believeſt not, thou haſt an Oath, a Pawn, and the greateſt part of thy Salvation already done to thy hand; nay, I'le tell thee more poor ſoul then thus; even Chriſt himſelf from all Eternity hath engaged for thee that thou ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; O then put not Chriſt to be challenged of his engagement by refuſing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel! ſurely when thou believeſt, thou makeſt Chriſts word good; he that believeth not makes <hi>God</hi> a liar; though in another ſenſe, and for ought he knoweth, even in this, that he fruſtrates Chriſts undertakings in the Covenant. And therefore believe; yea, and cry, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief;</hi> increaſe my Faith, till I come to full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Faith. Faith in this ſenſe is the very Eye of the Soul, reading is Name Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of Life; it is an apprehenſion of our particular Election.

O in theſe things lyes the ſtrength of love.</p>
                  <p>But alas! this is, or at leaſt this ſhould be thy grief, that thou canſt not love ſo well, and ſo warmly as thou art beloved: Chriſt comes towards thee <hi>Skipping like the Hart, or Roe on the Mountaines of ſpices,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant 8 14.</note> but thy love towards Chriſt is creeping like the worme in the unwholſome valley. Indeed the beſt affections have their fits of ſwooning: it may be for the preſent thy love is cold: O but come up to this fire, conſider how God and Chriſt loved thee in every of theſe. —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His project to ſave they ſoul ſprung out of his love: love was the firſt wheele that ſet all the eternall works of God a going; what was that great deſigne of God, but onely an expreſſion of his love? it was his pleaſure to communicate himſelf, and the riſe of that communication was his love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Counſels of God were all in love; had not love been as <hi>Preſident of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> where hadſt thou been? when all the attributes of God were at a ſtand, it was the love of God in Chriſt that reſolved the queſtion for thy ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The foreknowledge of God was a foreknowledge of love and approbation: in his eternal love he embraced thee as his own; he foreknew thee, <hi>(i.)</hi> of his free love he ſet thee apart to life and to ſalvation; <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt before the foundation of the World:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.4.</note> he choſe us in Chriſt, but not for Chriſt; nothing at all moved him to Elect thee but his own good pleaſure and free love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The purpoſe of God was a reſolution of love, it ſpeaks his love to be a conſtant, ſetled abiding love;<note place="margin">John 13.1.</note> no unkindneſs ſhall alter it, <hi>for having loved his own, he loves them unto the end,</hi> nay, he loves them without end, from everlaſting to everlaſting.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The decree of God was an order (as I may call it) or an act of love, to give in time that grace unto his elect, which before all time he decreed ſhould be an effectual means to bring them unto glory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The covenant betwixt God and Chriſt was an agreement of love: God and Chriſt ſtruck hands to ſave our ſouls;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>grace was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the World began.</hi> Grace was given us, that is, the gracious love and favour of God in Chriſt was given us before all ſecular times. This was <hi>Gods</hi> meaning from everlaſting, this was the deſigne, yea the greateſt deſigne that ever God had, to ſet out the infinite glory, and the riches of his love in Jeſus Chriſt. No queſtion but he had other great deſignes in doing ſuch great things as he hath done; but above all the deſignes that ever God had in all his works, this is the chiefe, to honour his mercy, to glorify the riches of his love and grace: had it not been for this he would never have made the World; and therefore in that World to come it will be the delight of <hi>God</hi> to ſhew his Saints and Angels what he is able to do for a creature; yea, he will to all Eternity declare to them, to what an height of excellency and glory his love and mercy is able to raiſe poor ſouls, ſo that the very Saints and Angels ſhall admire, &amp; adore, and magnifie the name of <hi>God</hi> everlaſtingly for it.</p>
                  <p>O my ſoul, canſt thou ponder on this, and not love him dearly who has thus loved thee? Come, <hi>ſtir up the gift that is in thee;</hi> if thou art a Chriſtian thou haſt ſome ſparks, though now (it may be) under the aſhes: come, rub, chaſe, and warm thy affections at this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94897:34"/> fire; love, like a watch, muſt be wound up, or elſe it will fall downwards: what doſt thou? why ſtand'ſt thou idle in the heat of the Day? Chriſt hath fire in his hand, 'tis but <hi>looking up,</hi> and reaching out thy hand to take it from him: O take it with both thy hands, and be thankful for it. Prayer, ejaculation, contemplation, judicious obſervation of the Spirits ſeaſon, are thy beſt inſtruments to kindle this fire of love in thee.</p>
                  <p>And methinks thy heart ſhould begin now to melt, methinks it ſhould receive more eaſie impreſſions from the object before it, methinks theſe eternal works and acts of God and Chriſt towards thy poor ſoul, <hi>ſhould begin to overcome thee,</hi>

O then how ſhould this but mightily inflame my heart with the love God, and love of Chriſt? how ſhould I chooſe but ſay as the Martyr did, <hi>Oh that I had as many lives, as I have haires on my head, to lay them down for Chriſt?</hi> Ah what flames of Divine affection, what rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of zeal, what raviſhments of delight, what extaſies of obedience can be enough for my bleſſed God, and deareſt Redeemer.</p>

We muſt pray that all theſe tranſactions betwixt God and Chriſt, may be aſſuredly ours, and that God would clear up our Titles more and more; yea, and ſeeing all good things tending to Salvation, were from all Eternity prepared for us, we are therefore to pray; that by prayer we may draw them down from Heaven; for what though our Evidences be clear? Yet this muſt not caſt out means; God doth not uſe to beſtow his ſaving Graces on lazy ſluggards; thoſe therefore who from the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Predeſtination do pretend that the duty of Prayer is ſuperfluous, do plainly ſhew that they have no certainty at all. <hi>Aquinas</hi>

We muſt praiſe God: what, that God ſhould look on us, and Predeſtinate us to Life? That he ſhould paſs by ſo many on the right hand and on the left, and <hi>that I ſhould be one whom the Lord did Elect? what, ſuch a vile, and ſinful Wretch as I am? was there ever like Love? was there ever like Mercy? may not Heaven and Earth ſtand amazed at this? O what ſhall I do to be thankful enough to this dear God?</hi> Thus thou that knoweſt thy intereſt in Chriſt, ſtudy praiſe and thankfulneſs. Say in thy ſelf, <hi>who made me to differ from thoſe Caſt-away Souls? Alas! we were all fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the ſame Mould, hewed out of the ſame Rock,</hi> It is ſtoried of one of the late French Kings, that in a ſerious meditation, conſidering his own condition of being King and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of that Nation, <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>when I was born, a Thouſand other Souls were born in this Kingdome with me, and what have I done to God more than they?</hi> O my Soul, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt thee and thoſe many Thouſands of Reprobates that live with thee in the world at this day? nothing, ſurely nothing but the free mercy, goodneſs, and love of God in Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. God and Chriſt counſelled about our Salvation; there was a great conflict in the Attributes of God; juſtice and mercy could not be reconciled, till the Wiſdom of God found out that glorious and wonderful expedient, <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo let us Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel about our Salvation: the fleſh and the ſpirit whereof we are compounded, draw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes, the Fleſh draws Hell-ward, and the Spirit Heaven-ward; come then, call we in heavenly and ſpiritual Wiſdome to decide this Controverſie; you may hear its Language in <hi>Job</hi> 28.28.<note place="margin">Job 28.28</note>

                  <p n="5">5. God and Chriſt loved us with an everlaſting Love. So muſt we love him who hath firſt loved us: this is the nature of ſpiritual Love: that it runs into its own Ocean, <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints!</hi> who hath more cauſe to love him then you have? who hath been loved ſo much? or who hath ſo much come under the power of love as you have?<note place="margin">Pſ. 31.23</note> hath not Chriſt loved you, not only with a love of well-wiſhing, which is from everlaſting (ſome call it the love of Election, the fountain-love, the well-head of ſalvation) but alſo with a love of complacency? hath not Chriſt ſhed abroad his love into your hearts, and ſhall he loſe by it; will not theſe cords of love draw up your hearts to love him again? ſure it's but reaſon to love him, who hath firſt loved you, yea, and loved you when you were unlovely, and had nothing in you worthy of love. <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> then it was that <hi>Chriſt</hi> loved you in rags, it is meet therefore that you ſhould love him in Robes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. God and Chriſt appointed, or purpoſed us unto ſalvation, his love was a ſure, and ſetled, and firme, and conſtant love: <hi>the purpoſe of God according to Election muſt ſtand.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.11 Pſ. 119 112.</note> So muſt we love him, and cleave unto him for ever: <hi>I have enclined my heart to perform thy Statutes alwayes even to the end.

                  <p n="7">7. God and Chriſt decreed, booked, and ſealed our ſalvation: and ſo muſt we put to our ſeal that God is true <hi>(i.)</hi> we muſt believe in Chriſt? for when we believe, we make
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94897:36"/> Chriſts word good. He that believes not, makes <hi>God</hi> a lyar, (as you have heard) in that he fruſtrates, or endeavors to fruſtrate Chriſts undertaking in his predeſtination.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> entered into Covenant concerning our ſalvation: So muſt we enter into Covenant with him; we muſt take him to be our <hi>God,</hi> and give up our ſelves to be his people: — Why thus we muſt in all particulars conform to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The ſum of all is this, <hi>we muſt be like</hi> Chriſt <hi>in grace, and gracious actings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my ſoul, ſee to this grace, ſee to this conformity to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in gracious act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and this will enable thee to read thy name written in the Book of Life. O abhor, &amp; repel that Devils dart, <hi>I am predeſtinated, and therefore I may live as I liſt;</hi> how contrary is this to the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.4</note> 
                     <hi>he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love?</hi> and <hi>as the Elect of</hi> God <hi>put on bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, forgiving one another, —Even as</hi> Chriſt <hi>forgave you?</hi> this conformity to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in grace is the very effect of our predeſtination:<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3 12, 13. Pſ. 45 21</note> 
                     <hi>O look unto Jeſus,</hi> and be in grace <hi>like unto Jeſus:</hi> why, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is full of grace, a veſſel filled up to the lip, or very brim, <hi>thou art fairer than the children of men, and grace is poured into thy lips. Chriſt</hi> was as it were grace ſpeaking, <hi>Luk</hi> 4.22. Grace ſighing, weeping, dying, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Grace living again, and now dropping, or rather rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down floods of grace on his living members, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the great <hi>Apple-tree,</hi> dropping down Apples of Life, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. and all that falls from this tree, as apples, leaves, ſhadows, ſmell, bloſſomes, are but pieces of grace fallen down from him, who is the fulneſs of all,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.1</note> and hath filled all things. Chriſt is <hi>the roſe of Sharon,</hi> and every leaf of this roſe is an Heaven; every white and red in it is grace and glory, every act of breathing out it's ſmell from everlaſting to everlaſting is Spotleſs and unmixed grace; why then my ſoul, if thou wilt conform to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> conform in this: <hi>Be holy as he is holy;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>of that fulneſs of grace that is in him, do thou receive even grace for grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſtians! where are we? O that ever men ſhould hear of ſo much grace, and of ſuch acts of grace in that eternity before all worlds, and yet no impreſſion of grace upon their hearts! O that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould both be in that buſineſs of Eternity: that heaven, hell, juſtice, mercy, ſouls, and deep wiſdome, ſhould be all in that rare piece, and yet that men ſhould think more of a Farme, an Ox, an houſe, a pin, a ſtraw, or of the bones of a crazy livelihood; <hi>O look up, look up,</hi> if thou art <hi>Chriſts,</hi> Conſider what he hath done for thy ſoul; why, thou art <hi>predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus far we have <hi>Looked on Jeſus</hi> as our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in that Eternity before all time untill the creation: Our next work is to <hi>Look on Jeſus,</hi> carrying on the great work of mans ſalvation in the Creation, the beginning of time, untill his firſt coming.</p>

                  <p>The Object is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> carrying on the work of mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in that dark time before his coming in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner is the world made, &amp; the things therein; but man was created, that way might be made for God to ſhew his grace in the ſalvation of his Elect. And now was it that Gods eternal project, and counſel, &amp; fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and purpoſe, and decree, and Covenant with Chriſt was to come into execution. Indeed at the firſt there was no need of Chriſt; for man at firſt was made in holineſs, the image of God, and to bear rule over the reſt of the viſible creatures; though this his ſtate was but of a little ſtanding. It was the received opinion in in former times, that our firſt parents fell the very ſame day in which they were created. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> amongſt the reſt writes, that they ſtood but ſix hours: but though we cannot deſcribe the certain time, very probable it is, that it was but ſhort: This we finde, that <hi>Moſes</hi> having ſet down the creation of man, without the interpoſition of any thing elſe, he comes immediatly to the fall; and the Devil no doubt took the firſt occaſion he poſſibly could, to bring man to the ſame damnation with himſelf. Well then, long it was not but <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin deprived himſelf, and all his poſterity of the image of God: All mankind was in his loynes, ſo by the order and appointment of God all mankind partake with him in the guilt of his ſins: Hence is the daily &amp; continual cry, not only of <hi>Adam, Abraham, David, Paul,</hi> but of every Saint, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> But ſweet ſouls, ſtay your complaints, here's Goſpel-news.—</p>
                  <p>In this ſad hour of temptation God ſtepped in: he will not leave man without hope; he tells the Devil who begun this miſchief; <hi>I will put enmity between thee, and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed, it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> At the very inſtant, when God was pronouncing judgment upon the ſeveral delinquents
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94897:37"/> in the fall; nay, before judgment was pronounced on the perſons tempted, <hi>Jeſus</hi> is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Covenant of grace is proclaimed. O the infinite riches of the mercy of God in Chriſt!</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, how comes <hi>Jeſus</hi> in? how carried he on the great work of our ſalvation in this dark time?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 1. By aſſuming and taking upon him the form and ſhape of man, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging ſome ſpecial offices in that reſpect: We read often of Chriſts apparition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation, and then eſpecially when he had to do with this great Nego<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iation of mans Eternal happineſs. Some think it not improbable that Chriſt aſſumed the form of man when he firſt created man; and ſo he made man, not only in his own image which he had as God, <hi>In holineſs, and true righteouſneſs,</hi> but in reſpect of that form which he had aſſumed. Howſoever this we find, that after man had ſinned, Chriſt then appeared, firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> then to <hi>Abraham,</hi> then to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> then to <hi>Jacob,</hi> then to <hi>Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> — firſt, he appeared to <hi>Adam</hi> in the garden, <hi>and they heard the voice of the Lord God, walking in the garden in the cool of the day.</hi> God as he is God hath neither voice to ſpeak, nor ſeet to walk, but aſſuming the form and ſhape of a man he exerciſed both: and ſo he was the firſt that publiſhed that firſt promiſe to the World, <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head.</hi> — 2. He appeared to <hi>Abraham in the plain of Mamre,</hi> where <hi>the Lord talked with Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> calls him <hi>the Judge of all the Earth,</hi> which can be aſcribed to none but Chriſt <hi>the Judge of quick and dead.</hi> Some from that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>your Father Abraham rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad,</hi> do gather that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not only with the eyes of faith (as all the reſt of the Patriarchs and Prophets did) but alſo in a viſible ſhape which he aſſumed, like unto that whereunto he was afterwards to be united; And ſo it was Chriſt that renewed the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> — 3. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 26.2. and to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.24, 30. and to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3. and to many others, of which I ſhall comment in order. And theſe apparitions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were as <hi>praeludiums</hi> of his Incarnation. But this is not the way I ſhall inſiſt upon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> carried on the great work of our ſalvation in that dark time, not by himſelf exhibited (as when he was Incarnate) but onely promiſed. The great King would firſt have his Harbingers to lead the way, before he himſelf would come in perſon. As the Lord had obſerved this method in creating the World, that firſt he would have dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then light, and as ſtill he obſerves this method in upholding the world, that firſt he will have dawning, and then clear day; ſo in the framing and upholding of his Church, he will firſt have <hi>Chriſt</hi> held forth in Ceremonies, Rites, Figures, Types, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Covenants; and then like a glorious Sun, or like <hi>the day-ſpring from on high he would viſit the world, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs.</hi> To this purpoſe we read, that as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo the Covenant of grace (which applies <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us) was firſt promiſed, and then promulgated: the Covenant of promiſe was that Covenant, which <hi>God</hi> made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt; to be Incarnate, crucified, and riſen from the dead; and it was meet that the promiſe ſhould go before the Goſpel, and be fulfilled in the Goſpel, that ſo a great good might earneſtly be deſired, before it was beſtowed. In a time of darkneſs men deſire light; as the morning-watch watcheth and longeth for the morning, ſo the obſcure revelation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a promiſe, raiſed the hearts of the Patriarchs to an earneſt deſire of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his coming in the fleſh. But in this obſcurity we may obſerve ſome degrees; before the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> the promiſe was more obſcure; the Law being given, even to the time of the Prophets, the promiſe was a little more clear; in the time of the Prophets, even to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, it was clearer yet; as the coming of the meſſias did approach nearer and nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, ſo was the promiſe clearer and clearer ſtill: Juſt as the approach of the Sun is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or further off, ſo is the light that goes before it greater or leſſer. In like manner was the Revelation that went before Chriſt more dim or clear, as the riſing of <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> was more remote, or nigh at hand. It was the good pleaſure of <hi>God</hi> to manifeſt the riches of his grace by degrees, and not all at once; we ſee to this very day, that God in his ſeveral approaches of mercy and goodneſs draws nearer and nearer to his Church: Even now in this marvellous light of the Goſpel we have our divine Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Sacraments, we ſee him afar off, we know but in part; but time ſhall come (even before his ſecond coming) that we, or our children ſhall ſee him more clearly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, immediatly. My preſent buſineſſe is to hold forth <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the Covenant of grace

                  <p>In every of theſe periods will appear ſome further and further diſcoveries of Gods mercy in Chriſt, of the Covenant of grace, of our <hi>Jeſus</hi> carrying on the great work of mans Eternal ſalvation in that dark time.</p>
                  <p>You heard before of the Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt concerning our ſalvation; but that was not the Covenant of grace which God immediately made with man as fallen; but a particular Covenant with Chriſt to be the Mediator. Or ſo far as it was a Covenant of grace, it was then made betwixt God and Chriſt, and after to be made betwixt God and us: for a time we were hid in the womb of Gods Election, and not being then capable to enter into Covenant with God, Chriſt undertook for us, but yet ſo that when we come to be regenerate, we are then to ſtrike Covenant our ſelves. And hence we read expreſly of Gods Covenanting with ſundry particular perſons, as with <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> Of which in the next Sections.</p>

                  <p>THe Covenant of grace in this ſenſe is nothing elſe but a compact made betwixt God and man, touching reconciliation, and life Eternal by Chriſt. Now the firſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth of this gracious Covenant was to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> immediatly after the fall, expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This promiſe as it is the firſt; ſo the hardeſt to be underſtood: it contains in it good news of the overthrow of Satans Kingdome, and of mans freedom by the death of Chriſt. But the obſcurity is ſuch, that <hi>Luther</hi> exceedingly complains,<note place="margin">Textus qui om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus debebat eſſe notiſſimus, a nemine quod ego ſciam, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentor &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp;c. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  </p>
                  <p>The occaſion was this. The Lord looking down from heaven, and ſeeing how Satan had prevailed againſt man, and in ſome ſort undone the whole fabrick of the creation, he reſolves upon Satans ruine, and mans preſervation; <hi>And the Lord God ſaid unto the Serpent, becauſe thou haſt done this, thou art curſed.</hi> This literally is underſtood of the Serpent, but Spiritually of the Devil; both were as means to draw man unto ſin, and therefore they are joyned as one in the puniſhment; <hi>The Lord cut off the feet of the Serpent</hi> (ſay the Rabbies) <hi>and curſed him;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſenſe of the Words we ſhall open theſe termes, as, 1. Who is the Serpent? 2. Who is the woman? 3. What is the ſeed of the Serpent? 4, What is the ſeed of the woman? 5. What is that <hi>Hu</hi> [in our Bible tranſlated <hi>it?]</hi> 6. What is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, and the bruiſing of it? 7. What is the heel of the ſeed of the woman, and the bruiſing of it? 8. Amongſt whom was the enmity, or rather enmities? for in the Text we find many Armies; <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who is the Serpent? I find diverſity of opinions among Interpreters: Some ſay, it was onely the Serpent, and that which belongs unto Satan is but myſtically under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: others ſay, it was onely Sathan under the notion of a Serpent, as ſometimes he is called the great Dragon, <hi>And the great Dragon was caſt out, that old Serpent called the

                     <hi>and Satan, which deceived the whole world.</hi> Others ſay, it was both Satan and the Serpent; as men are ſaid to be poſſeſſed of Satan, ſo was the Serpent poſſeſſed of the Devil. Satan could not provoke our firſt parents to ſin by any inward temptation, as now he doth by the help of our corruption: nor could he enter into their bodies or minds, becauſe of the holineſs and glory that was in them; and therefore he preſumed to take a beaſt of the earth, and by diſpoſing of his Tongue he ſpeaks within him. But what? muſt the Serpent have puniſhment, that was only Satans inſtrument in the temptation? yes:</p>
                  <p>Such was Gods love to man, that he condemns both the Author and inſtrument of that that evil: as one that in anger breaks the ſword wherewith his ſon, or his friend was wounded; ſo Gods breaks Satans ſword: the Serpent is punniſhed according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Text, and Satan is puniſhed in the ſpiritual meaning of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Who is the woman? Some are all for Allegories, and thy will tell you, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and the Woman are the ſuperiour &amp; inferiour faculties of the Soul; and that ever ſince the Fall there hath been a continual War betwixt theſe: but I look at this Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary as vain and trifling, though it be fathered on ſome of the Antients, and of no ſmall note; others ſay, this Woman is the Bleſſed Virgin, in relation to which, they read the laſt words thus, <hi>ſhe ſhall bruiſe thy head;</hi> this reading is not only allowed, but confirmed by the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and in ſome of their Prayer-books, thy call her <hi>The Mother of the Lord, the Tree of Life, the breaker of the Serpents head, and the Gate of Heaven.</hi> But I look on this Commentary as ignorant &amp; Idolatrous,<note place="margin">Antiphona de domina noſtra ſecundum uſum Eccleſ <hi>Hilden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhem.</hi>
                     </note> and wholly derogatory to the Kingdom of Chriſt. Others are not ſo eaſily miſlead, and therefore ſay, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whereſoever mentioned in this Text, is <hi>Eve,</hi> and none but <hi>Eve;</hi> ſhe it was whom the tempter had ſeduced, and in juſt judgment for her familiarity with the tempter, God meets with her, <hi>I will put enmity (ſaith God) between thee and the Woman.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. What is the <hi>Seed of the Serpent?</hi> in Scripture phraſe <hi>Seed</hi> is ſometimes taken colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, for many at once; as when the Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 17 17, 18</note> 
                     <hi>and to thee and thy Seed will I give this Land: and I will multiply thy Seed as the ſand of the Sea:</hi> and ſometimes it is taken ſingularly for one only perſon; thus <hi>Eve</hi> called her Son <hi>Seth, for God, ſaid ſhe, hath appointed me another Seed inſtead of Abel:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 4.25 Gen. 22.18</note> and ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>in thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> Now in this place <hi>the Seed of the Serpent</hi> is taken collectively, for all the families of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.4</note> for the <hi>Devil and his Angels</hi> (as Chriſt calls them) and for all the Sons of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (i.) for all reprobate men whoſe Father and Prince is the Devil; as Chriſt told the <hi>Jews, ye are of your Father the Devil,</hi>

                     <hi>he that committeth ſin is of the Devil — in this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil:</hi> and thus both Devils and reprobates are reckoned as the ſeed of the Serpent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What is <hi>the Seed of the Woman?</hi>—The Seed of the Woman is that poſterity of the Woman which do not degenerate into the Seed of the Serpent: that is the meaning of the firſt ſentence, <hi>I will put enmity;</hi>—and then it follows, <hi>between thy Seed and her Seed:</hi> and for this ſenſe we have theſe arguments. 1. The oppoſition of the Seeds, for as the Seed of the Serpent is taken collectively, ſo the Seed of the Woman muſt be taken collectively, that the oppoſition may be fit. 2. The enmities fore-ſpoken do ſtrongly evince it: now the enmities pertain both to <hi>Eve</hi> and to all her poſterity (if godly) to the end of the world; hence <hi>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> ſaith the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.18.</note>

This was the Proto-evangel, or firſt Goſpel that ever was publiſhed after the Creation. O bleſſed news, fit for Gods mouth to ſpeak, and to break firſt to the world now fallen!

                  <p n="1">1. Some obſerve that this Sentence is ſeparated from the former with a Period or great ſtop: however God goes on to ſpeak of the Seed of the Woman, yet he ſays not, <hi>and that Seed ſhall bruiſe thy head,</hi> for ſo we might have thought he had ſpoken of that Seed collectively as he did before; but ſtopping there, and not repeating the ſame word again, he gives it thus; <hi>it</hi> or <hi>he ſhall bruiſe thy head;</hi> (i.) ſome individual perſon of that ſame Seed, ſome ſingular one of that ſame common Seed of the Woman <hi>ſhall bruiſe thy head;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> alone of all the Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> goes forth to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him; ſo Chriſt alone of all the Seed of the Woman was ſo to fight with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by his own power as to overcome him, and to <hi>bruiſe his head.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. God himſelf in other places of Scripture doth expreſly declare that this <hi>Seed</hi> here promiſed is Chriſt, and only Chriſt: mark but where this promiſe is repeated to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, as when the Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

For the heel, it is the humanity of Chriſt, according to which properly Chriſt hath an heel: Or (as others) it is the wayes of Chriſt, which Satan, by all the means he could poſſibly would ſeek to ſuppreſs. 2. For <hi>the bruiſing of his heel,</hi> it is the miſeries, mockings, woundings, Death and Burial of Chriſt, all which he endured in his heel <hi>(i.e.)</hi> in his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; or it extends further, to all the hurts, reproaches, afflictions, perſecutions of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by the Devil and his agents: all which are but as a <hi>bruiſe in the heel,</hi> which cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the ſpiritual life of their ſouls. It is obſerved, that the Serpent hath but one head, but the ſeed of the woman hath two heels; ſo that the one may be ſome help, while the other is hurt; beſides, an hurt in the heel is far from the head and heart; and though it may be painful, it is not mortal. Indeed, <hi>Chriſts heel was bruiſed (i.e.)</hi> He was delivered to death, even to the death of the Croſs; yet he roſe again from the dead; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the Devil any advantage by his death; for as angry Bees ſtinging once, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves droanes, ſo the Devil, now he may hiſs at us, but he cannot hurt us; by that wound which Chriſt received at his death, he wounded all his enemies irrecoverably; the very ſight it ſelf was Chriſts triumph; even then was the Kingdom of darkneſs utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; ſin, death, and Satan were conquered, and taken captive, and whatſoever might

                  <p n="1">1. That a Saviour was promiſed from the beginning of the world. 2. That this Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhould free all his Saints from ſin, death, and hell; the head and power of the Devil. 3. That to this end this Saviour ſhould be a Mediator; for God would not grant an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate pardon, but the promiſed ſeed muſt firſt intervene. 4. That this Mediator ſhould be of the ſeed of the woman, that is, a man; and yet ſtronger then the Devil, indued with a Divine power, and ſo he is God. 5. That this Man-God ſhould accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Prieſtly office be a Sacrifice for ſin, the Serpent ſhould <hi>bruiſe his heel,</hi> he ſhould ſuffer and dye for the people; and yet accordingly to his Kingly office he ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Satan; for he <hi>ſhould bruiſe his head,</hi> overthrow his Kingdom, and make us more than Conquerors in him that loved us. 6. That this promiſe of Chriſt and of our juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is free; God of meer mercy, and free-grace brings forth this promiſe, there could be now after the fall no merit in man; and even now he promiſeth remiſſion of ſins, and life Eternal in, for, and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. No queſtion but in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this promiſe the Patriarchs and Fathers of old obtained life, glory, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: <hi>By faith the Elders obtained a good report: by faith Abel obtained witneſs that he was righteous: by faith Enoch was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee Death: by faith Noah became heir of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> &amp; how ſhould it but revive us in theſe laſt times, to hear, that the firſt thing that ever God did after the World was fallen, it was this act of mercy, to make a promiſe of Chriſt, and to reconcile loſt man to himſelf through the ſame Jeſus Chriſt? ſurely he began to do that ſoon, which he meant to be alwayes a doing, even to the end of the World.

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. What is a Covenant? <hi>It is a contract of mutual peace and good will, obliging parties on both hands to the performing of mutual benefits and offices.</hi> Thus was the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was a mutual ſtipulation in it, on Gods part to performe his promiſes of temporal, ſpiritual, and Eternal grace; and on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part to receive this grace by faith, and to performe due obedience and thankfulneſs to God. Hence a little nearer, we ſay the Covenant is a mutual compact, or agreement betwixt God and man, whereby God promiſeth all good things, eſpecially Eternal happineſs unto man; and man doth promiſe to walk before God in all acceptable, free, and willing obedience, expecting all good from God, and happineſs in God, according to his promiſe, for the praiſe and glory of his grace. Others, deſcribing the Covenant of grace (for with the Covenant of works we will not meddle) they give it thus, <hi>The Covenant of grace is a free and gracious compact, which God of his meer mercy in Jeſus Chriſt hath made with ſinful man, promiſing unto him pardon of ſins and eternal happineſs; If he will but repent of ſin, and embrace mercy reached forth by faith unfeigned; and walk before God in willing, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſincere obedience.</hi> —In this deſcription many things are conſiderable. As, 1. That the Author of this Covenant is God; not as our Creator, but as our merciful God and Father in Chriſt Jeſus. 2. That the cauſe of this Covenant is not any worth, or dignity or merit in man, but the meer mercy, love, and favour of God. 3. That the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Covenant is Jeſus Chriſt, in and through whom we are reconciled unto God; for ſince God and man were ſeparated by ſin, no Covenant can paſs betwixt them, no reconciliation can be expected, nor pardon obtained, but in and through a Mediator. 4. That the party Covenanted with, is ſinful man; the fall of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was the occaſion of this Covenant, and God was pleaſed to permit the fall, that he might manifeſt the riches of his mercy in mans recovery. 5. That the form of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſtands on Gods part in gracious and free promiſes of forgiveneſs, holineſs, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and on mans part in a reſtipulation of ſuch Duties as will ſtand with the free grace and mercy of God in Chriſt. 6. That the ſtipulation on mans part required, is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſin, belief in the promiſes; and a yielding of fear, reverence, worſhip, and obedience to God according to his word. Theſe I might inſiſt on, but my purpoſed brevity will not permit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is the eſtabliſhing of this Covenant? Some ſay, this ſpeaks the duration of it, of which anon; I ſuppoſe it intends alſo the confirmation of it. We find that the Lord had before made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.4, 5.<note place="margin">Gen. 15.4, 5</note> And now he doth not aboliſh the former, and make another; but rather, he renews, confirms, and eſtabliſheth the former. It may be there was ſome heſitation or doubting in <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſo we ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1, 2.<note place="margin">Gen 15.1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.3</note> But now God would aſſure him infallibly of his will and purpoſe: O when a man hears that God will vouchſafe ſo much favour as to enter into a covenant with him; he is ready to ſay as <hi>Gideon</hi> did,<note place="margin">Judg. 6.15.</note> 
                     <hi>alas, my family is poor in Manaſſes, and I am the leaſt in all my Fathers houſe; and who am I that I ſhould be raiſed up hitherto? that God ſhould make ſuch promiſes as theſe to me?</hi> And hence, to prevent ſuch Objections, the Lord will confirm
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94897:40"/> and <hi>eſtabliſh his Covenant;</hi> as ſometimes by his Promiſes; ſometimes by an oath, ſometimes by the blood of Chriſt himſelf; ſometimes by ſeals. So here in this very place, God adds the ſeal of Circumciſion, <hi>Ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your fore-skin (ſaith God) and it ſhall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you.</hi>

Circumciſe your ſelves ſaith God, and when I ſee the Circumciſion, I will remember my Covenant, and I will make good to you all the promiſes thereof. — But what is Circumciſion to the Covenant? much every way; Circumciſion was not without ſhedding of blood, becauſe the Covenant was not yet eſtabliſhed in the Blood of the Meſſiah, ſure there was much in this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the rite of it ſelf was nothing, yet as it led the faithful Patriarchs to the Blood of Chriſt, and as it aſſured the purging away of ſin by the Blood of Chriſt, and as it ſigned the Circumciſion of the heart by the Spirit of Chriſt, ſo it found acceptance with God; no ſooner he looks on it, but he remembers his Covenant, and confirms it, and makes it good to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed after him.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A parte poſt,</hi> as continuing from everlaſting to everlaſting.

                  <p n="5">5. What are the priviledges of the Covenant? I anſwer, the priviledges of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are many, as they are great things, and great bleſſings which our great God promiſeth, ſo they are very many and numerous; the Covenant is full of bleſſings, it is a rich ſtore-houſe, repleniſhed with all manner of bleſſings; it is not dry, nor bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, but like the fat Olive or fruitful Vine, it is a Well of ſalvation, a fountain of good things, a treaſure full of goods, or unſearchable riches, which can never be emptied, nor come to an end.

Jam. 2.23 Gen 45.25, 26</note> the word <hi>believed</hi> imports, that he thought the Word of God to be ſure, certain, ſtable, and conſtant; it is ſuch a belief as is oppoſed to fainting, as it is ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> when he heard the report of his ſons that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, <hi>his heart fainted,</hi> becauſe he believed not; but when he believed, his heart revived; and <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I had fainted,

This was the very condition of the covenant which God required of <hi>Abraham; q. d. Abraham,</hi> doſt thou believe that ſuch a Meſſiah ſhall be ſent into the world? art thou able to believe? yes, <hi>I believe Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Abraham;</hi> well ſaith God, I will put thee to the trial; I will give thee a Son, though thou art as a dead man, and <hi>Sarah</hi> as a dead woman; yet I will promiſe thee a ſon, art thou able to believe? again, thou ſeeſt the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> thou haſt not one foot in it, yet I will give thee this land in the length and bredth of it for thy poſſeſſion, art thou able to believe this? you will ſay, what are theſe to the condition of the covenant, which is only to believe in God, and to believe in Jeſus Chriſt? O yes, 1. Theſe were ſhaddows of the great promiſe, Chriſt; and therefore that act of faith, whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> believed that he ſhould have a ſon, and that his Children ſhould poſſeſs the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was likewiſe a branch, a ſhaddow, a pledge of that main act of faith whereby he believed the promiſed ſeed, in whom himſelf &amp; all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. But 2. Let this be remembred that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not only believe the temporal promiſes, but every promiſe; <hi>as I will be thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward; now</hi> who is our ſhield but Chriſt; and who is our reward but Chriſt? but eſpecially he believed the promiſe of the ſeed, and who is the head of the ſeed but Chriſt? yea, he believed in that promiſed ſeed <hi>in whom all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed;</hi> and who was that but Chriſt? <hi>your father Abraham</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day,</hi>

That God on his part expreſſeth his conſent and willingneſs to be their God: this will appear in the preface of the Law, of which hereafter. 2. That the people on their part give their full conſents, and ready willingneſs to be his ſervants. Both theſe appear in that, 1. Moſes writes down the Covenant Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-wiſe. 2. He Confirms the Covenant by outward ſigns, as by the blood of Calves and Goats; whereof one half he puts in baſons, to ſprinkle it on the people; and the other half of the blood he ſprinkles on the Altar; that ſprinkling on the people ſignified their voluntary Covenanting with God, and the blood ſprinkled on the Altar ſignified Gods entering into Covenant with the people.

Whether this were laid down only as a peculiar argument to the <hi>Jews</hi> to keep the Commandments, or it belongs alſo to us, being grafted in, and become of the ſame ſtock with them, I ſhall not diſpute: this is without any controverſie that their bondage was typical, and ours ſpiritual: you ſee the good things promiſed in this Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What is the condition of this covenant on our part as we may gather it hence? The condition of this covenant is faith in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which is implyed in the promiſe, <hi>I will be thy</hi> God, or <hi>I am the</hi> Lord <hi>thy</hi> God: and commanded in the precept built upon it, <hi>thou ſhalt have me to be thy</hi> God, or <hi>thou ſhalt have no other</hi> Gods <hi>before me.</hi> But where is faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt mentioned either in promiſe or precept? I anſwer, if it be not expreſſed, it is very plainly intended, or meant: God is not the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but in and through the Mediator: neither can <hi>Iſrael</hi> take God to be their God, but by faith in the Meſſiah. In the prophets we read frequently theſe exhortations,: <hi>truſt in the Lord, commit thy ſelf unto the Lord, lean upon the Lord, and roul, thy burden upon the Lord:</hi> but what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets exhort unto, that is commanded in this expreſſure of the Covenant? and who can truſt in the Lord, or commit himſelf to the Lord, or lean upon the Lord, or roul his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then on the Lord, if he be a ſinner, unleſs it be in and through a Mediator? <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt walk before God in all well-pleaſing; and the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe</hi> God. But to go further, what is the meaning of this firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the affirmative part, but to <hi>have one</hi> God <hi>in Chriſt to be our</hi> God <hi>by faith?</hi> it is true,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> there is no mention made of Chriſt, or faith, but that is nothing; is there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love, and yet our Saviour diſcovers and commands it there; when the Lawyer tempted Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, which is the great Commandment in the Law?</hi> you know Chriſts anſwer,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.36, 37, 38.</note> 
                     <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord thy</hi> God <hi>with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, this is the firſt and great Commandment, Mat.</hi> 22, 36, 37, 38. Now as our Saviour diſcovers <hi>love</hi> there, ſo in like manner is faith and Chriſt there the neceſſary conſequents. But you may object, what ſay we to obedience? is not that rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this covenant thus ſhining in the Law?</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Law and obedience are Correlatives. But in this caſe we are not to look to the Law as meerly mandatory; we gave you the ſence of the word, and how it is uſed as a covenant of grace? remember only this; the Law is conſidered either more ſtrictly, as it is an abſtracted rule of righteouſneſs, holding forth life upon no other terms but perfect obedience; or more largely, as that whole doctrine delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94897:45"/> preface and promiſes adjoyned: in the former ſenſe it is a Covenant of works? but in the latter ſenſe it is a covenant of grace. — And yet I dare not ſay, that as the Law is a covenant of grace, it doth exclude obedience. In ſome ſort obedience as well as faith may be ſaid to be a condition of the covenant of grace; I ſhall give you my thoughts in this diſtinction, obedience to all Gods commandments, is either conſiderable as a cauſe of life, or as a qualification of the ſubject; in the former ſenſe it cannot be a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the covenant of grace, but in the latter ſenſe it may, if by condition we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whatſoever is required on our part, as precedent concomitant, or ſubſequent to the Covenant of grace, repentance, faith, and obedience are all conditions; but if by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> we underſtand whatſoever is required on our part as the cauſe of the good promiſed, though only inſtrumental, why then faith, or belief in the promiſes of the covenant is the only condition: faith and obedience are oppoſed in the matter of juſtification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Covenant, not that they cannot ſtand together in one ſubject, for they are inſeparable united; but becauſe they cannot concur and meet together in one court, as the cauſe of juſtification or ſalvation. Now when we ſpeak of the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, we intend ſuch a condition as is among the number of true cauſes; indeed in the Covenant of works, obedience is required as the cauſe of life; but in the Covenant of grace, though obedience muſt accompany faith, yet not obedience, but only faith is the cauſe of life contained in the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Who was the Mediator of this Covenant? to this we diſtinguiſh of a double Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>viz.</hi> Typical, and Spiritual; <hi>Moſes</hi> was a typical, but Chriſt was the ſpiritual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: and herein was Moſes priviledged above all before him; he was the Mediator of the Old Teſtament, Chriſt reſerving himſelf to be the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant, (i.)</hi> of the New Teſtament. <hi>Moſes</hi> received the Law from God,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> and delivered it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo he ſtood a Mediator between God and the people; never was mortal man ſo near to God as <hi>Moſes</hi> was; <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed was called Gods friend; but <hi>Moſes</hi> was Gods favorite; and never was mortal man either in knowledge, love or authority ſo near unto the people as <hi>Moſes</hi> was (which makes the <hi>Jews</hi> (O wonder) to Idolize him to this very day. <hi>Moſes</hi> was called in as a Mediator on both parts. 1. On Gods part, when he called him up to receive the Law, &amp; all thoſe meſſages which God ſent by him to the people. 2. On the peoples part when they deſired him to receive the Law; for they were afraid by reaſon of the fire, and durſt not go up into the Mount:<note place="margin">Deut. 5.5.</note> mark how he ſtiles himſelf as a Mediator: <hi>At that time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſtood between the Lord and you to ſhew you the word of the Lord:</hi> He was Gods mouth to them, and he was their mouth to God; and he was a prevailing Mediator on both parts: he prevailed with God for the ſuſpending of his Juſtice, that it ſhould not break out upon the people; and he prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the people to bind them in Covenant unto God, and to make profeſſion of that Obedience which the Lord required and called for; yet for all this, I call him not a Mediator of Redemption, but Relation: A great deal of difference there is betwixt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> as 1. <hi>Moſes</hi> only received the Law, and delivered it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but <hi>Chirſt</hi> our true <hi>Moſes</hi> fulfilled it. 2. <hi>Moſes</hi> broke the Tables, to ſhew how we in our Nature had broken the Law, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> our true <hi>Moſes</hi> repairs it again. 3. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had the Law only writ in Tables of Stone, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> writes it in the Tables of our hearts. 4. <hi>Moſes</hi> was meer man, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is God as well as man: <hi>Moſes</hi> was only a Servant in Gods Houſe, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Son; yea, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Lord of his own Houſe the Church: <hi>Moſes</hi> mediation was of this uſe, to ſhew what was the true manner of worſhipping God, but he did not inſpire force and power to follow it; he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile men to God as of himſelf, and therefore it appeared that there was need of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reconciler, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. What of Chriſt, and of his death do we find in this manifeſtation of the Covenant? I anſwer, 1.

                  <p n="2">2. In the Law it ſelf, as it is a Covenant of Grace, we find ſomething of Chriſt; in the preface he proclaims himſelf to be our God; and in the firſt Commandment we are bound to take this God to be our God; and in the ſecond, he gives us a double Reaſon or Motive to obey; <hi>for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, I ſhew mercy unto thouſands of them that love me and keep my Commandments.</hi> And in the fifth Commandment he gives a promiſe of long life in <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is either to be look'd at as a type of Heaven, or literally, for a proſperous condition here on earth; but howſoever it is by virtue of the Covenant, and as a teſtimony of Gods love; now all theſe promiſes are made in Chriſt: God is not our God but in and through Jeſus Chriſt; God will not ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto thouſands, nor unto one of all the thouſands of his Saints, but as they are in Jeſus Chriſt: God will not give us long life here, or eternal life hereafter, but in, for, and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: what if <hi>Moſes</hi> writ not down the word <hi>Chriſt]</hi> yet certainly <hi>Moſes</hi> writ of <hi>Chriſt]</hi> his words imply <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Chriſt himſelf told the <hi>Jews,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. In the Expoſition of the Law, as <hi>Moſes</hi> gives it here and there, we find ſomething of Chriſt. Yea if we obſerve it, <hi>Moſes</hi> brought ſomething more to the expreſſion of Chriſt, and of the Covenant of Grace, than ever was before: in the firſt promiſe it was revealed that Chriſt ſhould be the Seed of the woman; in the ſecond manifeſtation of the promiſe, it was revealed that Chriſt ſhould be of the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> writings, and <hi>Moſes</hi> time, we learn more expreſly that Chriſt was to be incarnate, and to have his Converſation amongſt men:<note place="margin">Ex. 29.45, 46</note> The promiſe runs thus; <hi>And I will dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Children of Iſrael, and will be their God, and they ſhall know that I am the Lord their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell amongſt them;</hi>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:94897:46"/>4. In the confirmation of the Law we find ſomething of Chriſt. It was confirmed by Seals and Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What, were all theſe but a type of Chriſt, in the formed expreſſion of the Covenant we found the Seal of Circumciſion, but now it pleaſed God to add unto the former another Seal for Confirmation of their Faith, <hi>ſc,</hi> the Paſſeover: and was not this a type of Chriſt, the immaculate Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſins of the world? Again, in this manifeſtation <hi>Moſes</hi> brought in the Prieſthood as a ſetled Ordinance to offer ſacrifices for the people: and was not this a type of Chriſt, our true and unchangeable High Prieſt? I have ſometimes ſeen the Articles of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Jews</hi> Creed, collected out of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; as thus, <hi>I believe that the Meſſiah ſhould die to make ſatisfaction for ſin:</hi> this they ſaw in their continued bloudy Sacrifices, and their deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi> by the death of a Lamb, taught them no leſs. 2. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he ſhall not die for his own ſins, but for the ſins of others:</hi> this they might eaſily obſerve in every ſacrifice, when (according to Law) they ſaw the moſt harmleſs birds and Beaſts were offered. 3. <hi>I beleive to be ſaved by laying hold upon his merits:</hi> this they might gather by laying their right hand upon the head of every Beaſt that they brought to be offered up, and by laying hold on the horns of the Altar, being a Sanctuary or Refuge from purſuing vengeance. Thus we might go on: No queſtion the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, the Prieſthood and Kingdom of Chriſt were prefigured and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Sacrifices, and the Brazen Serpent, and the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And I cannot but think that the godly ſpiritual <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood this very well; and that theſe did not reſt in Sacrifices or Sacraments, but that by faith they did really enjoy Chriſt in every of them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the intention of Gods giving the Law we find ſomething of Chriſt. The very end of God in holding forth the Law, was, that upon the ſenſe of our impoſſibility to keep it, and of our danger to break it, we ſhould deſire earneſtly, and ſeek out dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for Jeſus Chriſt: to this purpoſe ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> Chriſt is the end of the Law <hi>(i.)</hi> Chriſt is the end of intention; God by giving ſo holy a Law, and by requiring ſuch perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he would thereby humble and debaſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo that they ſhould earneſtly fly to Chriſt: in this ſenſe <hi>the Law is our School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith.</hi> A School-Maſter (you know) doth not only whip or correct, but alſo teach and direct: ſo the Law doth not only threaten and curſe if the work be not done, but it ſhews where power and help is to be had, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If this be ſo, how much to blame are they, that under pretence of Free-Grace and Chriſt, cry down the Law? Rather let us cry it up, and this is the way to ſet up Free-Grace and Chriſt. Surely he that diſcovers his defects by the perfect rule of the Law, and whoſe Soul is imbittered and humbled becauſe of thoſe defects, he muſt needs prize Chriſt, deſire Chriſt, advance Chriſt in his thoughts above all the men in the world.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. In that God is the firſt that ſeeks after us, to draw us into Covenant with him; we ſeek not him, but he ſeeks us; we chuſe not him, but he chuſeth us; <hi>he loves us firſt; I am found of them that ſought me not:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that there is nothing in us, to draw God into a Covenant with us: many a man ſeeks firſt after the unmarried Virgin, but then there is Beauty, or there is Dowry, or there is ſomething or other which draws on the man; but there is no ſuch thing in us: this made <hi>David</hi> ſay, when he heard of Gods Covenant with him and his, <hi>Who am I, O Lord God?</hi>

                     <hi>and what is my Fathers Houſe that thou haſt brought me hitherto? — and is this the manner of man, O Lord God? q. d.</hi> O Lord God, thou dealeſt familiarly with me as a man dealeth with man;<note place="margin">1 Chr. 17.17.</note> or as it is elſewhere, <hi>Thou haſt regarded me according to the eſtate of a man of high degree.</hi> It would make any ſoul cry out, that deeply weighs the freeneſs of this Covenant;<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.4.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that there is enough in us to keep off the Lord from ever owning us; we are as contrary to God as darkneſs is to light, or as evil is to good: <hi>The carnal mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is not ſubject to the Law of God,</hi>

                     <hi>neither indeed can it be.</hi> We are a crooked Generation, that cannot abide the ſtraight wayes of the Lord; our whole nature is ſinful and corrupt before him, and for the moſt part when we are moſt averſe and backward, and have leaſt thought of ever ſeeking after him, then it is that he ſeeks us, to take us unto himſelf; thus the Lord called <hi>Saul</hi> when he was Perſecuting, and raging, and breathing out ſlaughter againſt the Lord, and againſt his Saints: and thus the Lord called thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>mocked</hi> the Apoſtles when they ſpake di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Languages, <hi>Theſe men are full of new wine;</hi> ay but the next word that they ſpake, is,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.4.

                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:94897:47"/>4. In that we are by nature no better than others that are without God,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> and <hi>without Covenant:</hi> what makes the difference betwixt us and them, but this free Grace of God? Is there any reaſon in us why one is taken into a Covenant, and another is not? Nay, I'le tell you a wonder; ſo it pleaſeth the Lord, that ſometimes God chuſeth the worſt, and leaves thoſe that are better than they; We read that Publicans and Harlots were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, and the righteous Generation which juſtified themſelves, and were juſtified by others, were paſſed by: ſurely God reſpects none for any thing in them; his deſign is that the freeneſs of his Grace might be ſeen in thoſe whom he takes to himſelf. Hence the Apoſtle, God <hi>chuſeth the fooliſh things of this world, and the weak things of this world,</hi> baſe and deſpiſed <hi>things;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.27, 28, 29.</note> whileſt in the mean time he paſſeth by the <hi>wiſe and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and things of high eſteem, that all men might ſee, it is the Grace of God, and not any thing in man, by which we are taken into Covenant with him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. How is the Covenant ſaid to be ordered? The word <hi>ordered</hi> will help us in the Anſwer: it ſets out to us a marſhalling, and fit laying of things together, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſorder and confuſſon; the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>And the men of Iſrael incouraged themſeves, and ſet their Battle again in array.</hi> As we ſee in an Army, every one is ſet in rank and file; ſo is every thing in this Covenant ranked, diſpoſed, ordered, that it ſtands at beſt advantage to receive and repel the enemy: a poor Chriſtian that hath a troubled ſpirit, he ſets himſelf againſt Free Grace and this everlaſting Covenant, he raiſeth thouſands of objections againſt it; but now the covenant is <hi>ordered,</hi> it ſtands like a marſhall'd Army to receive him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him. Come, let us ſee how it is <hi>ordered in all things.</hi> I ſhall inſtance only in theſe particulars: As, —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is well ordered in reſpect of the Root out of which it grew: This (ſay Divines) was the Infinite Soveraignty, and Wiſdom, and Mercy of God. 1. It was founded in Gods Soveraignty; he had a right to do what he would with his fallen Creatures: he might damn or ſave whom he pleaſed: <hi>Hath not the Potter Power over the Clay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.21.</note> 
                     <hi>of the ſame lump to make one <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſſel unto honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> 2. It was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in wiſdom: The Covenant of Grace was a reſult of Council; it was no raſh act, but a deliberate act with infinite wiſdom: God being the Soveraign of all his Creatures, and ſeeing mankind in a periſhing condition, he determined within himſelf deliberately to make ſuch a Covenant of Peace, firſt with Chriſt, and then with all the Elect in Chriſt. 3. It was founded in Mercy, <hi>(i e.)</hi> in the goodneſs of God flowing out freely to one in miſery: for mercy, we ſay, is made up of theſe two Acts. 1. There muſt be an Object of Miſery. 2. There muſt be a free efflux of goodneſs on that Object. Now the Covenant of Grace was founded on theſe; as, 1. There was an Object of Miſery, loſt man, wretched man, undone by ſin: and, 2. There was an efflux of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his very bowels moved within him, and they could not hold: <hi>I have loved thee, with an everlaſting love</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 31.3.</note> Surely this was well ordered; a perplexed ſoul may have his ſpirit up in arms againſt the Covenant of Grace, O, cries the Soul, in its ſad condition, <hi>I am miſerable, I ſhall not live, but die, my ſins will damn me, I am loſt for ever.</hi> Why, but ſee how the Covenant is ordered in reſpect of the root or riſe: it ſtands like a well marſhalled Army to receive, and to repel thoſe doubts: as, 1. God acted in a way of Soveraginty, and cannot God ſave thee if he will? 2. God acted in a way of Wiſdom, and though thou ſeeſt no way but one with thee, Death and Damnation; yet cannot infinite wiſdom contrive another way? 3. God acted in a way of Mercy, and <hi>O thou afflicted toſſed with tempeſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 54.11.</note> 
                     <hi>and not comforted,</hi> is not infinite Mercy above all thy Miſery? Why ſee, ſee poor ſoul how the Covenant repels all thy oppoſitions in reſpect of its riſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is well ordered in reſpect of the perſons intereſted in it from all eternity, and they are God the Father, and in Jeſus Chriſt his Son; as for the Saints Elect, they were not then, and therefore the Covenant could not be immediately ſtruck with them; now there was great need of this order; for ſhould the Covenant have been made betwixt God the Father and the Elect from all eternity, and that immediately, a troubled ſoul would have oppoſed it thus. 1. If it was from all eternity, how then ſhall I be capable of it? alas my being was not ſo long ſince. 2. If it were made with me immediatly, then I had ſome part to perform of mine own Power and Strength; but alas I have failed, I can do nothing: O but now the Covenant is a well ordered Covenant, in theſe reſpects: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath been from all eternity? and thou, as an Elect Veſſel hadſt thy being in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94897:48"/> him, as he was thy Head. 2. Chriſt is able to perform the Covenant, and being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, it lies upon his ſcore to ſatisfie his Father; he that firſt made the bargain, muſt look to fulfill it; and for thy part, if thou doſt any thing, it muſt be through him. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 15.5.</note> Why, ſee now, ſee how the Covenant repels all thy oppoſitions in reſpect of the Perſons intereſted in it from all eternity; God hath his place, and Chriſt his place, and Faith his place, and the Sinner his place.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is well ordered in reſpect of the method of the Articles in their ſeveral workings? firſt God begins, then we come on: firſt, God, on his part, gives Grace and Glory, and then we, on our parts, act Faith and Obedience: God hath ever the firſt work; as firſt,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33, Eze. 36, 26, 31 Ezek. 36.25, Ezek. 36.27 Zech. 12.10,</note>

                  <p n="4">4. It is well ordered in reſpect of the end and aim, to which all the parts of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are referred;<note place="margin">Eph. 1.6,</note> the end of the Covenant is the <hi>praiſe of the Glory of his Grace:</hi> the parts of the Covenant are the Promiſe and the Stipulation; the Promiſe is either Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal or Immediate, and that is God and Chriſt; or ſecondary and conſequential, and that is Pardon, Juſtification, Reconciliation, Sanctification, Glorification; and the Stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on our parts are Faith and Obedience: we muſt believe in him that Juſtifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and walk before him in all well pleaſing. Obſerve now the main deſign and aim of the Covenant, and ſee but how all the ſtreams run towards that Ocean: God gives himſelf <hi>to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, God</hi> gives <hi>Chriſt to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, God</hi> gives pardon, juſtification, ſanctification, ſalvation <hi>to the praiſe of the Glory of his Grace;</hi> and we Believe, we Obey <hi>to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace;</hi> and good reaſon, for all is of Grace, and therefore all muſt tend <hi>to the Praiſe of the glory of his grace:</hi> it is of Grace that <hi>God</hi> hath given himſelf, Chriſt, pardon, juſtification, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, ſanctification, ſalvation to any Soul; it is of grace that we believe; <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through faith,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why is it called <hi>a New Covenant?</hi> I anſwer; It is called <hi>New,</hi> either in reſpect of the late and new Bleſſings, which God vouchſafed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in bringing back their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity with Joy, and planting them in their own Land again; or it is called <hi>New,</hi> in reſpect of the Excellency of this Covenant: Thus the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were wont to call any thing Excellent,<note place="margin">Pſal. 96.1.</note> 
                     <hi>New. O ſing unto the</hi> Lord <hi>a New Song,</hi> Pſal. 96.1. that is, an Excellent Song: Or it is called <hi>New,</hi> in contradiction to the Covenant of Promiſe before <hi>Chriſt</hi> came. In this latter Senſe, the very ſame words here, are repeated in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 8.8.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold the Dayss come, ſaith the</hi> Lord, <hi>when I will make a New Covenant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Houſe of</hi> Judah.— <hi>In that He ſaith a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, He hath made the Firſt Old; now, that which decayeth, and waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> The <hi>New-Covenant</hi> is uſually underſtood in the latter Senſe; it is <hi>New,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diverſe from that which <hi>God</hi> made with the Fathers before <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it hath a new Worſhip, new Adoration, a new Form of the Church, new Witneſſes, new Tables, new Sacraments and Ordinances; and theſe never to be abrogated or diſannulled, never to <hi>wax Old,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks: Yet in reſpect of thoſe new Bleſſings, which <hi>God</hi> beſtowed upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> immediately after the Captivity, this very Manifeſtation may be called <hi>New:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 23.7, 8.</note> And in reference to this; <hi>Behold the Dayes come, ſaith the</hi> Lord, <hi>that they ſhall no more ſay, The</hi> Lord <hi>liveth, which brought up the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of the Land of</hi> Egypt; <hi>but, The</hi> Lord <hi>liveth, which brought up, and which led the Seed of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of the</hi> North-<hi>Countrey, and from all Countries whither I had driven them, and they ſhall dwell in their own Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wherein doth the Expreſſure of His Covenant excel the former, which <hi>God</hi> made with their Fathers? I anſwer, —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It excels in the very Tenor, or outward Adminiſtration of the Covenant; for this Covenant, after it once began, continued without Interruption until <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereas the Former was broken, or did expire. Hence <hi>God</hi> calls it a <hi>New-Covenant;— Not according to the Covenant, which I made with their Fathers in the Day that I took them by the Hand, to bring them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>which my Covenant they brake, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I was an Husband unto them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> In this reſpect it might be called <hi>New,</hi> or, at leaſt it may be called an <hi>Inchoation of the New,</hi> becauſe it continued till <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which no other Expreſſure of the Covenant did before, and ſo it excelled all the former.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It excels in the Spiritual Benefits and Graces of the Spirit. We find, that under this Covenant they were more plentifully beſtowed upon the <hi>Church,</hi> than formerly. Mark the Promiſes:<note place="margin">Jer. 24.6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>I will ſet My Eye upon them for Good, and I will bring them again to this Land; and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not bluck them up; and I will give them a Heart to know Me, that I am the</hi> Lord; <hi>and they ſhall be My People, and I will be their</hi> God; <hi>for they ſhall return unto Me with their whole Heart.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hag. 2.7, 8, 9.</note> —Again, <hi>I will ſhake all Nations, and the Deſire of the Nations ſhall come, and I will fill this Houſe with Glory, ſaith the</hi> Lord <hi>of Hoſts: The Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, ſaith the</hi> Lord <hi>of Hoſts; the Glory of this latter Houſe ſhall be greater than
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94897:49"/> of the former, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. And I will put my Law in their inward parts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 31.33, 34.</note> 
                     <hi>and write it in their Hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People, and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquities, and I will remember their Sins no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It excels in the diſcovery and revelation of the Mediator, in and through whom this Covenant was made: In the former expreſſion we diſcovered much, yet in none of them was ſo plainly revealed the time of his coming, the place of his birth, his name, the paſſages of his nativity, his humiliation and kingdom, as we find them in this. —</p>

                  <p n="3">3. How doth God put the Law into our inward parts? I anſwer, God puts the Law into our inward parts by enlivening or qualifying of a Man with the Graces of Gods Spirit, ſuitable to his Commandment; firſt, there is the Law of God without us, as we ſee it or read it in Scriptures; but when it is put within us, then God hath wrought an inward diſpoſition in our minds, that anſwers to that Law without us; for example, this is the Law without; <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 6.5. Deut. 30.6.</note> To Anſwer which, there is a promiſe; <hi>I will circumciſe thy Heart, and the Heart of thy Seed, to Love the Lord thy God with all thy

Jer. 32.40.</note> Again, this is the Law without, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord, and keep his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and his Statutes, and his Commandments to do them:</hi> to anſwer which, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; <hi>I will make a Covenant with you, and I will not turn away from you to do you good, but I will put my fear into your hearts, and you ſhall not depart from Me;</hi> now when this promiſe is accompliſhed, when God hath put the affection and grace of fear within our hearts, when the habit of fear is within, anſwerable to that Command without, then is the Law put into our hearts. Surely this is Mercy that God ſaith in his Covenant, <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts;</hi> many a time a poor Soul cries out, he is troubled with ſuch and ſuch a luſt, and he cannot keep this and that Commandment, he cannot out-wreſtle ſuch and ſuch ſtrong inclinations to evil, O but then go to God, and preſs him with this, <hi>Lord, it is a part of thy Covenant, thou haſt ſaid, thou wilt circumciſe my heart; thou haſt ſaid, thou wilt put thy Law in my inward parts; thou haſt ſaid, thou wilt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve theſe luſts, Lord, I beſeech thee do it for thy Covenants ſake.</hi>—But here's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion:</p>
                  <p>How may we know this inward work of Grace, this Law in our inward parts? the beſt way to ſatisfy our doubts in this, is to look within; open we the door and cloſet of our hearts, and ſee what lies neareſt and cloſeſt there; that we ſay is intimate and within a man,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> which lies next to his heart: <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than Me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is not worthy of Me:</hi> We know the love of Father and Mother is a moſt natural thing; it comes not by teaching, but it is in-bred in us as ſoon as we are born; and yet if we love not Chriſt more than theſe, if Chriſt lye not cloſer to our hearts than Father or Mother, we are not worthy of Chriſt; our natural life is a moſt inward and deep thing in a man,<note place="margin">Job. 2.4. Luke 14.26. Gal. 2.20.</note> it lies near the heart; <hi>Skin for Skin</hi> (ſaid the Devil once truly) <hi>and all that a man hath will he give for his Life;</hi> but <hi>he that hates not Father and Mother— yea and his own life alſo</hi> ſaid Chriſt) <hi>he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle, to expreſs this intimate, inward life of grace, he ſaith, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> What an emphatical ſtrange expreſſion is this? <hi>I live, yet not I but Chriſt liveth in me; q. d.</hi> I live not the life of ſenſe, I breath not bodily breath, that is, comparatively to the life of faith; his very natural life, though inward, is ſaid not to be lived, in reſpect of his life of grace, which is more inward. And let this ſerve for reſolution to that queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What is it to have the <hi>Law written in our hearts?</hi> This writing contains the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and is ſomething more; the Metaphor is expreſſed in theſe Particulars.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is ſaid to be written, that there might be ſomething within, anſwerable to the Law without; it was written without, and ſo it was written within. This writing is the very ſame with copying or tranſcribing. The writing within is every way anſwerable to the writing without: Oh what a mercy is this, that the ſame God who writ the Law with his own finger in the Tables of Stone, ſhould alſo write the ſame Law with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Spirit in the Tables of our Hearts! as you ſee in a Seal, when you have put the Seal on the Wax, and you take it off again, you find in the Wax the ſame Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that was on the Seal: So it is in the hearts of the faithful, when the Spirit hath once ſoftned them, then he writes the Law <hi>(i.e.)</hi> he ſtamps an inward aptneſs, an inward diſpoſition on the heart, anſwering to every particular of the Law; this is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the Law of the mind, I ſee another Law in my Members warring againſt the Law of my mind:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> Now what is this Law in the mind, but a diſpoſition within, to keep in ſome meaſure every Commandment of the Law without? and this is the writing of the Law (or if you will) the copying or tranſcribing of the Law within us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is ſaid to be written, that it might be rooted and rivetted in the heart, as when Letters are engraven in Marble; ſo is the manner of Gods writing: if God write, it can never be obliterated or blotted out: Letters in Marble are not eaſily worn out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; no more are the writings of Gods Spirit: Some indeed would have them as writings in duſt: but if <hi>Pilate</hi> could ſay, <hi>What I have written, I have written;</hi> how much more may God? Hence are all thoſe promiſes of perſeverance; <hi>My Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him,</hi> Pſal. 89.28. and, <hi>The root of the righteous ſhall not be moved,</hi> Prov. 12.3. and, <hi>Even to your old Age I am he; and even to hoary hairs will I carry you,</hi> Iſa. 46.4. I deny not, but men of glorious gifts may fall away; but ſurely the pooreſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94897:50"/> Chriſtian that hath but the ſmalleſt meaſure of Grace, he ſhall never fall away; if the Law be written in our hearts, it ſtill remains there; Grace habitual is not removeable: ſooner will the Sun diſcard its own beams, than Chriſt will deſert or deſtroy the leaſt meaſure of true Grace which is a Beam from the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is ſaid to be <hi>written,</hi> that it might be as a thing legible to God, to others, and to our ſelves. 1. To God, he writes it that he may read it, and take notice of it; he exceedingly delights himſelf in the graces of his own Spirit: and therefore the Spouſe after this <hi>writing,</hi> after the planting of his grace in her,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.6.</note> ſhe deſires him to <hi>come into his Garden, and eat his pleaſant Fruits; q. d.</hi> Come, read what thou haſt written; come, and delight thy ſelf in the graces of thy own Spirit: the only delight that God has in the world is in his Garden, a gracious ſoul; and that he might more delight in it, he makes it fruitful: and thoſe fruits are precious fruits; as growing from plants ſet by his own Hand, reliſhing of his own Spirit, and ſo fitted for his own taſte. 2. The Law is written that it might be legible to others. So <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>You are manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt:</hi> How manifeſtly declared? why, <hi>known and read of all Men.</hi> As we are able to read Letters graven in ſtone, ſo may others read and ſee the fruits and effects of this Law written in our Hearts. And good reaſon; for whereſoever God works the principles of grace within, it cannot but ſhew it ſelf in the outward life and converſation: it is Gods promiſe, firſt <hi>I will put my Spirit within them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 36.27. Mat. 12.34.</note> and then <hi>I will cauſe them to walk in my ſtatutes;</hi> and it is Gods truth, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> What the mind thinketh, the hand worketh. 3. The Law is written that it may be legible to our ſelves; a gracious heart is privy to its own grace and ſincerity, when it is in a right temper: if others may read it by its fruits, How much more we our ſelves, who both ſee the fruits, and feel that habitual diſpoſition infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us? Nor is this without its bleſſed uſe; for by this means we come to have a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evidence both of Gods Love to us, and of our Love to God. You ſee now what we mean by this <hi>writing</hi> of the Law within us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. How are we taught of God, ſo as not to need any other kind of teaching compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively? I anſwer.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God teacheth inwardly, <hi>In the hidden part thou haſt made me know wiſdom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.6. Pſal. 16.17.</note> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> and again, <hi>I thank the Lord that gave me counſel, my reins alſo inſtruct me in the night ſeaſon.</hi> The reins are the moſt inward part of the Body, and the night ſeaſon the moſt retired and private time; both expreſs the intimacy of divine teaching; man may teach the brains, but God only teacheth the reins: the knowledge which man teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is a ſwimming knowledge; but the knowledge which God teacheth,<note place="margin">Cathedram ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet in coelis qui corda doces <hi>Aug.</hi>
                     </note> is a ſoaking knowledge. <hi>God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts.</hi> Mans light may ſhine into the head, but Gods light doth ſhine into the heart: <hi>His Chair is in Heaven that teacheth hearts,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God teacheth clearly, <hi>Elihu</hi> offering himſelf inſtead of God to reaſon with <hi>Job,</hi> he tells him, <hi>My words ſhall be of the uprightneſs of my heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job. 33.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and my lips ſhall utter know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge clearly.</hi> If ever the Word come home to an heart, it comes with a convincing clearneſs. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Our Goſpel came unto you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much full aſſurance.</hi> The word hath a treble Emphaſis,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.5.</note> aſſurance, full aſſurance, and much full aſſurance; here is clear work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God teacheth experimentally; the ſoul that is taught of God can ſpeak experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally of the Truths it knows. <hi>I know whom I have believed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.12.</note> I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced his faithfulneſs and all-ſufficiency, I dare truſt <hi>my all</hi> with him, I am ſure he will keep it ſafe to that day. Common knowledge reſts in generals, but they that are taught of God, can ſay, <hi>As we have heard, ſo we have ſeen;</hi> they can go along with every truth, and ſay, <hi>It is ſo indeed, I have experienced this and that Word upon my own Heart.</hi> In this caſe the Scripture is the Original, and their Heart is the Copy of it, as you have heard; they can read over the Promiſes and Threatnings, and ſay <hi>Probatum eſt. David</hi> in his Pſalms, and <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles ſpeaks their very Hearts, and feels their very temptations, and makes their very objections: they can <hi>ſet to their Seal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.33.</note> 
                     <hi>that God is true;</hi> they can ſolemnly declare by their lives and converſations that God is true and faithful in his word and promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God teacheth ſweetly and comfortably: <hi>Thou haſt taught me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.102.103.</note> and then it follows, <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte? Yea, ſweeter than the Honey to my Mouth?</hi> He rolled the word and promiſes as Sugar under his Tongue, and ſucked from thence more ſweetneſs than <hi>Sampſon</hi> did from his Honey-comb: <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>he

                  <p n="7">7. How is God ſaid to <hi>forgive iniquity, and never more to remember Sin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, God is ſaid to <hi>forgive iniquity</hi> when guilt of ſin is taken away; and for the ſecond, God is ſaid <hi>never more to remember Sin,</hi> in that the Sinner, after pardon, is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94897:51"/> never more looked on as a Sinner. Is not this the Covenant? <hi>q. d.</hi> I will remove thy Sins, and do them away, as if they had never been; I will blot them out of the Book of my Memory; I will obliterate the Writing, that none ſhall be able to read it. But you will ſay, If Sin remain ſtill in the Regenerate, How are they ſo forgiven, as to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred no more? Divines tell us of Two Things in every Sin; there is <hi>macula &amp; reatus;</hi> the Filth, and the Guilt: This Guilt ſome again diſtinguiſh into the Guilt of Sin, which they call the Inward Dignity, and Deſert of Damnation; and the Guilt of Puniſhment, which is the Actual Ordination of a Sinner unto Damnation. Now, in different Reſpects we ſay, That Sin remains ſtill in Believers, and Sin doth not remain in Believers: <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we ſpeak of the Filth of Sin, or of the Deſert of Damnation; ſo it remains ſtill: but if we ſpeak of the actual Obligation of a Sinner to Condemnation, ſo it remains not after Pardon; but the Sinner is as free as if he had never ſinned.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Is not the Filth of Sin done away, when Sin is remitted? I anſwer, The Filth of Sin is not done away by Remiſſion, but by Sanctification and Renovation; and becauſe in this Life we have not a perfect inherent Holineſs, (Sanctification at beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Imperfect, and wrought in us by degrees) therefore during this Life, there is ſomething of the Filth of Sin, and eſpecially of the Effects of Original Sin, ſticking and ſtill cleaving to us. But, here is our Comfort, and herein lies the ſweet of the Promiſe, that when <hi>God</hi> hath pardoned Sin, He takes away the Guilt, as to Condemnation; He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits the Sinner of that Obligation; He now looks upon him not as a Sinner, but as a Juſt Man; and ſo in this Senſe He will forgive, and never more remember his Sin. Ah Chriſtians! Take heed of their Doctrine, who would have Juſtification an Abolition of Sin in its real Eſſence, and Phyſical in-dwelling; let us rather ſay with Scripture, that all juſtified Saints muſt take down their Top-ſail, and go to Heaven halting, and that they carry their Bolts and Fetters of in-dwelling ſin through the Field of Free-Grace, even to the Gates of Glory: Chriſt daily Waſhing, and we daily Defiling, to the end that Grace may be Grace.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Wherein is the Difference then betwixt the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> or betwixt the Old and New Manner of the Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace?</p>
                  <p>They are one for Subſtance; but in regard of the manner of Diſpenſation, and revealing in the ſeveral Times, Ages, States, and Conditions of the Church, there is a difference. I ſhall reduce all to theſe Particulars: They are diſtinguiſhed, —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the Object: In the Old Adminiſtration <hi>Chriſt</hi> was promiſed; but in the New-Covenant <hi>Chriſt</hi> is exhibited: It was meet, the Promiſe ſhould go before the Goſpel, and be fulfilled in the Goſpel, that ſo great a Good might earneſtly be deſired before it was beſtowed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the Federates: Under the Old Diſpenſation they are compared to an Heir under Age, needing a Gardian, Tutor, or School-maſter; little differing from a Servant: But in the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> they are compared to an Heir come to ripe Years; ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>

In the Manner of their Worſhip: In the <hi>Old-Teſtament</hi> they were held under the Ceremonial Law; and Oh, What an heap of Ceremonies, Rites, Figures, &amp; Shadows did they uſe in their Worſhip! Certainly theſe declared the Infancy and Non-age of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who being not capable of the high Myſteries of the Goſpel, they were taught by their Eyes, as well as their Ears. Theſe Ceremonies were as Rudiments, &amp; Introductions fitted to the groſs and weak Senſes of that Church, who were to be brought on by little and little, through ſuch Shadows and Figures, to the true Image, and thing ſignified: But in the New-Covenant or Teſtament, our Worſhip is more ſpiritual: Our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath told us,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2.

We muſt <hi>know Jeſus</hi> carrying on the great work of our Salvation in the beginning, and from the beginning of the World: Come let us learn what he did for us ſo early in the morning of this World: He made it for us, and he made us more eſpecially for his own Glory; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after we were made, we ſinned and marred the Image wherein God made us; this was the ſaddeſt Act that ever was; it was the undoing of man, and (without the mercy of God) the damning of all Souls, both of men and women to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; and, O my Soul, <hi>know this for thy ſelf,</hi> thou waſt in the loins of <hi>Adam</hi> at that ſame time, ſo that what he did, thou didſt; thou waſt partaker of his Sins, and thou waſt to partake with him in his puniſhment: but well maiſt thou ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be God for Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> at the very inſtant when all ſhould have been, damned, Chriſt interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; a Covenant of Grace is made with man, and Chriſt is the Foundation, in and through whom we muſt be reconciled unto God: Come ſoul, and ſtudy this Covenant of grace in reference to thy ſelf; had not this been, where hadſt thou been? nay, where had all the World been at this day? Surely it concerns thee to take notice of this great Tranſaction. After man had fallen by Sin, Chriſt is promiſed; &amp; that all the Saints might partake of Chriſt, a Covenant is entred; this at the beginning of the World, was more dim, but the nearer to Chriſts coming in the Fleſh, the more and more clearly it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Howſoever dimly, or clearly, thus it pleaſed God in Chriſt to carry on the great work of our Salvation at that time, <hi>viz.</hi> by a Promiſe of Chriſt, and by a Covenant in Chriſt, and for thy better knowledge of it, ſtudy the Promiſe made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Come Soul, ſtudy theſe ſeveral breakings out of the Covenant of Grace;<note place="margin">Col. 1.26</note> it is worth thy pains, it is <hi>a Myſtery which hath been hid from Ages, and from Generations, but now is made manifeſt to the Saints.</hi> Here lies the firſt and moſt firm Foundation of a Chriſtians comfort; if thou canſt but ſtudy this, and aſſure thy ſelf of thy part in this, thou art bleſſed for ever; O how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably ſweet and ſatisfying is it to a ſelf-ſtudying Chriſtian, to know the faithful engagements of the Almighty <hi>God,</hi> through that Son of his Loves, in a Covenant of Grace.</p>

                     <hi>my horſes as thy horſes:</hi> So it is betwixt God and us. If once he gives us the Covenant, then his ſtrength is our ſtrength, his power is our power, his armies are our armies, his attributes are our attributes, we have intereſt in all; there is an offenſive and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Language, (as I may ſay) betwixt God and us; and if we put him in mind of it in all our ſtraits, he cannot deny us. As it was with the Nations allied to <hi>Rome,</hi> if they fought at any time, the <hi>Romans</hi> were bound in honour to defend them; and they did it with as much diligence as they defended their own City of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo it is with the people allied to God, he is bound in honour to defend his People, and he will do it if they implore his aid; how elſe, is it poſſible God ſhould break his Covenant? will he not ſtir up himſelf to ſcatter his, and our ſpiritual enemies? Certainly he will. Thus runs the tenour of his Covenant, <hi>I will be a</hi> God <hi>to thee and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> This is the general promiſe; I may call it the Mother-Promiſe, that carries all other Promiſes in its womb; &amp; we find a Jeſus in this promiſe, conſider that it is God in Chriſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94897:54"/> that is held forth to us in this phraſe, <hi>I will be as a God to thee:</hi> O ſweet! Here is the greateſt promiſe that ever was made; Chriſt God is more than Grace, Pardon, Holineſs, Heaven, as the Husband is more excellent than the Marriage-Robe, Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Rings; the Well and Fountain of Life is of more excellency than the ſtreams; Chriſt Jeſus the objective happineſs, is far above a created and formal Beatitude which iſſueth from him. O my Soul is not this worthy of thy inmoſt conſideration? But of this more in the next.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider <hi>Jeſus</hi> in that promiſe made to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites, I am the</hi> Lord <hi>thy God who brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the Houſe of Bondage.</hi> Much hath been ſaid to this Promiſe before as matter of thy Conſideration; but to contract it, conſider in the Promiſe the ſufficiency and propriety; 1. Here is ſufficiency: it is a promiſe of infinite worth, an hid treaſure, a rich poſſeſſion, an overflowing bleſſing which none can rightly value; it is no leſs than the great, and mighty, and infinite God; if we had a promiſe of an hundred worlds, or often heavens, this is more than all; heaven indeed is beautiful, but God is more beautiful; for he is the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and hence it is that the Saints in heaven are not ſatisfied without their God; it is a ſweet expreſſion of <hi>Bernard, As whatſoever we give unto thee,</hi> Lord, <hi>unleſs we give our ſelves, cannot ſatisfie thee; ſo whatſoever thou giveſt unto us, Lord, unleſs thou giveſt thy ſelf, it cannot ſatisfie us:</hi> and hence it is, that as God doth make the Saints his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo God is the Portion and Inheritance of his Saints. Conſider the greatneſs, the goodneſs, the all-ſufficiency of this promiſe, <hi>I am the Lord thy God!</hi> No queſtion but <hi>Moſes</hi> had many other rich promiſes from God, but he could not be ſatisfied without God himſelf: <hi>if thy preſence be not with us, bring us not hence.</hi> And no wonder, for without God all things are nothing;<note place="margin">Exod. 33.15.</note> but in the want of all other things, God himſelf is inſtead of all: <hi>It is</hi> Gods <hi>alone Prerogative to be an univerſal good.</hi> The things of this world can but help in this or that particular thing: as Bread againſt hunger, Drink againſt thirſt, Cloaths againſt cold and nakedneſs, Houſe againſt wind and weather, Riches againſt poverty, Phyſick againſt ſickneſs, Friends againſt ſolitarineſs: but God is an alſufficient good; he is all in all both to the inner and outward man. Are we guilty of Sin? there is mercy in God to pardon us. Are we full of infirmities? there is Grace in God to heal us. Are we ſtrong in Corruptions? there is power in God to ſubdue them in us. Are we diſquieted in Conſcience? there is that Spirit in God that is the Comforter, that can fill us with Joy unſpeakable and glorious: And for our outward man all our welfare is laid up in <hi>God,</hi> he is <hi>the</hi> God <hi>of our Life</hi> Pſal. 42.8. he is <hi>the ſtrength of our Life.</hi> Pſal. 27.1. he is <hi>a quickning Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.45 Which though it be in regard of the inner man, yet there it is ſpoken of the inward man, which the Lord ſhall quicken after death, and doth now keep alive by his mighty power; for in <hi>him we live,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>O my Soul, that thou wouldſt but ruminate, and meditate, and conſider this promiſe in all thy wants &amp; diſcontents: when means fail, and the ſtreames run no more, O that thou wouldeſt then go to the Fountain, where the waters run ſweeter, and more ſure:<note place="margin">Gen. 41.16.</note> for as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh it is not in me,</hi> God <hi>ſhall give Pharaoh an anſwer of peace:</hi> So may Silver and Gold, and ſuch things ſay to thee, It is not in us; God ſhall give enough out of himſelf: have God, and have all: want God, and there is no content in the enjoyment of all: It was the Apoſtles caſe <hi>as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.10.</note> Surely he lived to God and enjoyed God, and he was an all-ſufficient good unto him: God may be enjoyed in any condition, in the meaneſt, as well as the greateſt, in the pooreſt as well as the richeſt: God will go into a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, into a priſon with his people, and there he will make up all that they are cut ſhort of. Thy diſcontents therefore ariſe not from the want of outward means, but from want of inward fellowſhip with God: and if thou doſt not find a ſufficiency, it is becauſe thou doſt not enjoy him who is thy all-ſufficient good: O ſtir up Faith, and conſider the Covenant, think ſeriouſly on this promiſe, <hi>I am</hi> God <hi>all-ſufficient: I am the Lord thy</hi> God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is the propriety of Saints, <hi>the Lord thy</hi> God. O what is this, that God is <hi>thy</hi> God? Heaven and Earth, Angels and Men may ſtand aſtoniſhed at it: What, that the Great and Mighty God, God Almighty, and God all-ſufficient ſhould be called <hi>thy</hi> God!<note place="margin">Heb. 11.16.</note> It is obſervable what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, God <hi>is not aſhamed to be called their</hi> God: Would not a prince be aſhamed to take a Beggar, a Runagate, a baſe and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Woman to be his Wife? But we are worſe than ſo, and God is better than
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94897:54"/> ſo; ſin hath made us worſe than the worſt of women, and God is better, holier, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the beſt of Princes: and yet God is not aſhamed to own us, nor aſhamed that we own him as our own, <hi>I am thy</hi> God. It is as if the Lord ſhould ſay, uſe me, and all my Power, Grace, Mercy, Kindneſs, as thine own: go through all my Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; conſider my Almighty Power, conſider my Wiſdom, Councel, Underſtanding, conſider my Goodneſs, Truth, Faithfulneſs: conſider my Patience, Long-ſuffering, Forbearance, all theſe are thine: as thus, My Power is thine, to work all thy works for thee and in thee, to make paſſage for thee in all thy ſtraits, to deliver thee out of ſix troubles and out of ſeven; my Wiſdom is thine, to counſel thee in any difficult caſes, to inſtruct thee in things that be obſcure, to reveal to thee the Myſteries of Grace, and the wonderfull things contained in my Law: my Juſtice is thine, to deliver thee when thou art oppreſſed, to defend thee in thy Innocency, and to vindicate thee from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of men: what needs more? O my Soul, think of theſe, &amp; all other Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes: ſay in thy ſelf <hi>all theſe are mine:</hi> nay more, think of God in Chriſt (for otherwiſe what haſt thou to do with God in a Covenant of grace?) and ſay in thy heart <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt is mine, my Saviour, my Redeemer, my <hi>head,</hi> my elder <hi>brother:</hi> his doings are mine, and his ſufferings are mine, his Life and his Death, his Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Seſſion and Interceſſion, all are mine: nay more, if Chriſt be mine, why then all good things are mine in Chriſt; I ſay in Chriſt, for they come not immediatly, but through the hands of a ſweet Redeemer; and though he be a man who redeemed us, yet becauſe he is God as well as Man, there is more of God and Heaven, and free-love in all our good things, than if we received them immediately from God: Ravens have their food, and Devils have their being from God by creature-right; but we have all we have from God in Chriſt by Covenant-right,: this ſurely, this very promiſe is the main and principal promiſe of the Covenant; it is the very ſubſtance, Soul and life of all: O then how careful ſhouldeſt thou be to improve the ſtrength of thy mind, thoughts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on this only ſubject?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider <hi>Jeſus</hi> in that promiſe made to <hi>David,</hi>

O conſider how the Covenant is ordered and marſhalled in reſpect of the Author of it, of the Perſons intereſted in it, of the parts of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, of the end and aim to which it refers: and in ſome of theſe, if not in all of theſe, thou wilt find thy Objections anſwered, removed, routed. 3. It <hi>is ſure:</hi> God is not faſt and looſe in his Covenant? heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, before one jot or title of his Word ſhall fail: conſider O my Soul, he both can and will perform his Word; his Power, his Love, his Faithfulneſs, his Conſtancy, all ſtand engaged. What ſweet mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is here for a Soul to dwell upon? what needs it go out to other objects, whilſt it may find enough here? but eſpecially what needs it to beſtow it ſelf upon vain things?

                  <p>WE muſt <hi>hope in Jeſus</hi> carrying on the great work of our ſalvation in a way of Covenant; now what is hope but a good opinion of enjoying its object; indeed a good opinion is ſo neceſſary for <hi>hope,</hi> that it makes almoſt all its kinds and differences; as it is greater or leſſer, ſo it cauſeth the ſtrength or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the exceſs or defect of this paſſion, <hi>hope:</hi> This good opinion is that which renders <hi>hope</hi> either doubtful, or certain; if certain, it produceth confidence or preſumption; preſumption is nothing but an immoderate hope without a ground: but confidence is that aſſurance of the thing hoped for in ſome meaſure, as if we had it already in hand. Hence it is that we uſually ſay we have great, and ſtrong, and good hopes, when we would ſpeak them aſſured; which hath occaſioned ſome to define it thus: <hi>Hope is a certain grounded confidence that the deſired good will come;</hi> not to inſiſt on this; all the queſtion is, Whether thoſe promiſes contained in the Covenant of grace belong unto me? and what are the grounds and foundations on which my <hi>hope</hi> is built? If the grounds be weak, then <hi>hope</hi> is doubtful, or preſumptuous; but if the grounds be right, then hope is right, and I may caſt Anchor, and build upon it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 9.13.</note> This is a Foundation of Chriſt, that becauſe the man is broken, and hath not bread, therefore he muſt be ſold, and Chriſt muſt buy him, and take him home to his fire-ſide, and cloath him, and feed him there. I know Satan argues thus, <hi>Thou art not worthy of Chriſt, and therefore what haſt thou to do with Chriſt?</hi> but Faith concludes otherwiſe, <hi>I am not worthy of Chriſt, I am out of meaſure ſinful, I tremble at it, and I am ſenſible of it, and therefore ought I, and therefore muſt I come to Chriſt;</hi> this arguing is Goſpel-logick, and the right method of a true and ſaving-faith: for what is faith, but the act of a ſinner humbled, weary, laden, poor, and ſelf-condemned? Oh take heed of their doctrine who make faith to act of ſome vile perſon never humbled, but applying with an immediate touch, his hot, boyling, and ſmoaking Luſts, to the bleeding bleſſed Wounds, and Death of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Conſider of that office of ſaving, and ſhewing mercy, which Chriſt hath ſet up; this is more than meerly a gracious inclination; Chriſt hath undertaken and ſet up an office to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt; to bring home ſtraying Souls to his Father, to be the great Peace-maker between God and Man, to reconcile God to man, and man to God, and ſo to be the Head and Husband of his People. Is not here a world of encouragement to believe in Jeſus? what? to conſider him as one who hath made it his office to heal, and relieve, and to reſtore, and to reconcile? Among Merchants I remember they have an office of ſecurity, that if you dare not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Seas, yet there you may be enſured, if you will but put in at that Office: in this manner Chriſt hath conſtituted and aſſumed the office of being a Mediator, the Redeemer, and the Saviour of men; he hath erected, and ſet up on purpoſe an office of meer love, and tender compaſſion, for the relief of all poor diſtreſſed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: if they dare not venture otherwiſe, yet let them put in at this office. O what jealous hearts have we that will not truſt Chriſt, that will not take the word of Chriſt without an office of ſecurity? ſurely Chriſt never ſo carried himſelf to any ſoul, that it need be jealous of his love and faithfulndeſs, yet this dear husband meets with many a jealous ſpouſe: O my ſoul take heed of this! Satan hath no greater deſign upon thee than to perſwade thee to entertain hard thoughts of Chriſt: believe! never ſay God will not take thee into Covenant, for to this purpoſe he hath erected an office to ſave and have mercy.</p>

                     <hi>ariſing from Faith.</hi> But to let theſe niceties paſs for a Spiders web (curious, but thin) certain it is that I cannot believe all theſe tranſactions of God, by Chriſt in a Covenant-way for me, but I muſt needs love that God, &amp; love that Chriſt who hath thus firſtly &amp; freely loved my ſoul;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94897:61"/> go on then O my Soul, put fire to the harth, blow on thy little ſpark, ſet before thee <hi>God's</hi> Love, and thou canſt not but love; and therein Conſider, 1. The Time. 2. The Properties. 3. The Effects of Gods love. 1. For The Time; He Loved thee before the World was made: haſt thou not heard? and wilt thou ever forget it? were not thoſe ancient Loves from all eternity admirable, aſtoniſhing, raviſhing Loves? 2, He Loved thee in the very beginning of the world: was not the promiſe expreſſed to <hi>Adam</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for thee? as thou ſinnedſt in his loins, ſo didſt thou in his loins receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head:</hi> And not long after, when God eſtabliſhed his Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, waſt not thou one of that Seed of <hi>Abraham? If ye are Chriſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3.29.</note> 
                     <hi>then are ye Abrahams Seed, and heirs according to the Promiſe.</hi> 3. He loves thee now more eſpecially, not only with a Love of benevolence, as before; but with a love of complacency: not only hath he ſtruck Covenant with Chriſt, with <hi>Adam,</hi> with <hi>Abraham</hi> in thy behalf, but particularly and perſonally with thy ſelf; and O what Love is this? If a woman lately conceiving, love her future fruit; how much more doth ſhe love it when it is born and embraced in her Arms? So if God loved thee before thou hadſt a being, yea before the world or any Creature in it had a being, how much more now? O the height, and depth, and length and breadth of this immeaſurable Love! O my Soul, I cannot expreſs the Loves of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to thee; I do but draw the Picture of the Son with a coal, when I endeavour to expreſs Gods love in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the properties of this Love: 1. Gods Love to thee is an eternal Love. He was thinking in his eternity of thee in this manner, <hi>At ſuch a time there ſhall be ſuch. Man and ſuch a Woman living on the earth: in the last times ſuch a one (I mean thou that readeſt, if thou believeſt) and to that Soul I will reveal my ſelf, and communicate my loves; to that ſoul I will offer Chriſt, and give it the hand of Chriſt to lay hold on Chriſt; and to that purpoſe now I write down the Name in the Book of Life, and none ſhall be able to blot it out again.</hi> Oh eternal Love! Oh the bleſſed tranſactions between the Father and the Son, from all eternity to manifeſt his Love to thy very Soul!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods love to thee is a choice Love; it is an elective, ſeparating Love: when he paſſed by and left many thouſands,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.2, 3.</note> then, even then he ſets his heart on thee: <hi>Was not Eſau Jacobs brother?</hi> ſaith <hi>God, yet I loved Jacob, and hated Eſau.</hi> So, wert not thou ſuch an ones Brother, or ſuch an ones Siſter that remained wicked and ungodly? wert not thou of ſuch a Family; whereas many, or ſome are paſſed by, yet <hi>God</hi> hath loved thee, and pitched his Love on thee: Surely this is choice Love.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.4. Deut. 7.7, 8.</note>3. Gods Love to thee is a free Love: <hi>I will love them freely,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>And the Lord did not ſet his Love upon you, and chuſe you, becauſe ye were more in number than any people, — but becauſe the Lord loved you;</hi> there can be no other reaſon why the Lord loved thee, but becauſe he loved thee. We uſe to ſay, this is a womans reaſon, <hi>I will do it becauſe I will do it;</hi> but here we find it is Gods reaſon, though it may ſeem ſtrange arguing; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> can go no higher, he loved thee, why? becauſe he loved thee.</p>
                  <p>Gods love to thee is the Love of all relations: look what a friends Love is to a friend, or what a Fathers Love is towards a Child, or what an Husbands Love is towards a Wife; ſuch is Gods Love to thee; thou art his Friend, his Son, his Daughter, his Spouſe; and God is thy All in All.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Effects of his Love: 1. God ſo Loves thee, as that he hath entered into a Covenant with thee. O what a Love is this? tell me, O my ſoul, is there not an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſparity betwixt God and thee? He is God above, and thou art a Worm below: <hi>He is the High and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe Name is Holy:</hi> and thou art leſs than the leaſt of all the Mercies of God: O wonder at ſuch a condeſcention! that ſuch a Potter, and ſuch a Former of things ſhould come on terms of bargaining with ſuch clay as is guilty before him! Had we the tongues of Men and Angels, we could never expreſs it!</p>
                  <p>God ſo loves thee, as that in the Covenant he gives thee all his Promiſes? Indeed what is the Covenant but an accumulation, or heap of Promiſes? As a cluſter of ſtars makes a Conſtellation; ſo as a maſs of promiſes concurreth in the Covenant of Grace; where-ever <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, cluſters of divine promiſes grow out of him; as the motes, rayes and beames are from the Sun. I ſhall inſtance in ſome few. As, —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God in the Covenant gives the world. <hi>All is yours, whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas or the World,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6 33.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Theſe temporary bleſſings are a part of the Covenant which God hath made to his People; <hi>It is he that giveth thee Power to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94897:61"/> get wealth, that he may eſtabliſh his Covenant which he ſware unto thy Fathers.</hi> Others,<note place="margin">Deut. 8.18.</note> I know, may have the World, but they have it not by a Covenant-right; it may be thou haſt but a little, a very little of the world; well, but thou haſt it by a Covenant-right, and ſo it is an earneſt of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As God in the Covenant gives thee the world, ſo in compariſon of thee and his other Saints, he cares not what becomes of all the world. <hi>I loved thee,</hi> ſaith God,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.4.</note> 
                     <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I give men for thee, and people for thy Life:</hi> If the caſe be ſo, that it cannot be well with thee, but great evils muſt come upon others, kindred, people and nations, <hi>I do not ſo much care for them,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>my heart is on thee, ſo as in Compariſon of thee, I care not what becomes of all the world:</hi> O the love of God to his Saints!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God in the Covenant pardons thy ſins; this is another fruit of Gods love: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins by his own blood;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 1.5.</note> it coſt him dear to pardon our ſins; even the heart-blood of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſuch were the tranſactions betwixt God and Chriſt: if thou wilt take upon thee to deliver ſouls from ſin (ſaith God to his Son) thou muſt come thy ſelf, and be made a Curſe for their Sin: Well (ſaith Chriſt) thy will be done in it; though I loſe my Life, though it coſt me the beſt blood in my heart, yet let me deliver them from ſin: This exceedingly heightens <hi>Chriſts</hi> Love, that he ſhould fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee thy ſin, and that yet he ſhould Love. Many times we ſet our Love on ſome outward unthankful Creatures, and we ſay, could I but have foreſeen this untowardneſs, they ſhould never have had my Love: but now the Lord did foreſee all thy ſins, and all thy ill requitals for love, and yet it did not once hinder his love towards thee, but he puts this in the Covenant, <hi>I will forgive their Iniquities, and remember their ſins no more.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 36.25.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. God in the Covenant gives thee Holineſs and Sanctification. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you:</hi> this Holineſs is our excellency in the eyes of Men and Angels: this is the Crown and Diadem upon the heads of Saints: whence <hi>David</hi> calls them by the name of <hi>excellent ones.</hi> Holineſs is a <hi>Spirit of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.14. it is the delight of God:<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3. 1 Pet. 4.14.</note> as a Father delights himſelf in ſeeing his own Image in his Children, ſo God delights him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Holineſs of his Saints: God loved them before with a love of benevolence and good-will, but now he loves them with a love of complacency:<note place="margin">Pſal. 47.11. Pſal. 149.4.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord takes pleaſure in thoſe that fear him; the Lord takes pleaſure in his People.</hi> Holineſs is the very Eſſence of God, the Divine Nature of God: O what is this, that God ſhould put his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into thee? <hi>You are partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> O what a love is this that God ſhould put his own Life into thee? that he ſhould enable thee to live the very ſame life that he himſelf lives? remember that piece of the Covenant, <hi>I will put my Law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. God in the Covenant gives thee the knowledg of himſelf: it may be thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him before: but 'tis another kind of knowledg that <hi>God</hi> now gives thee than thou hadſt before. When God teaches the Soul to know him, it looks on God with another eye: it ſees now another beauty in God than ever it ſaw before: for all that knowledg that it had before, bred not love: only Covenant-knowledg of God works in the Soul a true Love of God. But how doth this Covenant-knowledg work this Love? I ſhall tell you my own experiences: I go through all the Virtues, Graces and Excellencies that are moſt amiable: and I look in the Scriptures, and there I find them in God alone: if ever I ſaw any excellency in any man, or in any Creature, I think with my ſelf, there is more in God that made that Creature: <hi>He that made the Eye, ſhall not he ſee?</hi> And ſo he that made that Lovelineſs, is not he Lovely? Now when by theſe Mediums I have preſented God thus lovely to my Soul, then I begin to feel my heart to warm. As when I conceive ſuch an <hi>Idea</hi> of a man, that he is of ſuch a carriage, behaviour, diſpoſition, that he hath a mind thus, and thus framed, qualified and beautified, why then I love him; ſo when I apprehend the Lord aright, when I obſerve him as he is deſcribed in his Word; when I obſerve his doings, and conſider his workings, and learn from all theſe together a right <hi>Idaea,</hi> opinion or apprehenſion of him, then my will follows my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and my affections follow them both; and I come to love <hi>God,</hi> and to delight in <hi>God.</hi> O here's a ſweet knowledg! ſurely it was <hi>God</hi>'s Love in Chriſt to put this bleſſed Article into the Covenant of <hi>grace; They ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>God</hi> in the Covenant of <hi>grace</hi> gives thee his Son.<note place="margin">John. 13.6.</note> God <hi>ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Nay more, as God hath given thee his Son, ſo he hath given thee

                     <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> Of joying in Jeſus in that reſpect.</head>
                  <p>WE muſt <hi>joy in Jeſus</hi> as carrying on the great work of our Salvation in a way of Covenant. I know our <hi>joy</hi> here is but in part; ſuch is the excellency of Spiritual <hi>joy,</hi> that it is reſerved for Heaven; God will not permit it to be pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect here below: and yet ſuch as it is (though mingled with cares and pains) it is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed duty; it is the light of our ſouls: and were it quite taken away, our lives would be nothing but Horrour and Confuſion: O my Soul, if thou didſt not hope to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter joy in all thy Acts, thou wouldſt remain languiſhing and immoveable, thou wouldſt be without action and vigour, thou wouldſt ſpeak no more of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or of a Covenant of <hi>grace,</hi> or of God, or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or Life, or <hi>glory.</hi> — Well then go on O my Soul, and joy in <hi>Jeſus;</hi> if thou loveſt him, what ſhould hinder thy rejoycing in him? It is a Maxime, that as Love <hi>Proceeds, ſo if there be nothing that retaines the Appetite, it alwayes goes from Love to Joy.</hi> One motion of the Appetite towards good is to be united to it, and the next Appetite towards good is to enjoy it: now Love conſiſts in union, and joy in fruition; for what is fruition, but a <hi>joy</hi> that we find in the poſſeſſion of that thing we love? Much ado there is amongſt Philoſophers concerning the differences of Love and Joy. Some give it thus; As is the motion of fluid Bodies which run towards their Center, and think to find their reſt there; but being there, they ſtop not, and therefore they return, and ſcatter themſelves on themſelves, they ſwell and overflow: So in the paſſion of Love, the Appetite runs to the beloved Object, and unites it ſelf to it, and yet its motion ends not there; for by this paſſion of joy, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the ſame way; again it ſcatters it ſelf on it ſelf, and overflows thoſe Powers which are neareſt to it; by this effuſion the ſoul doubles on the Image of the good it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and ſo it thinks to poſſeſs it more; it diſtills it ſelf into that faculty, which firſt acquainted it with the knowledg of the Object, and by that means it makes all the parts of the Soul concur to the poſſeſſion of it. Hence they ſay, <hi>That joy is an effuſion of the Appetite, whereby the Soul ſpreads it ſelf on what is good, to poſſeſs it the more perfectly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to ſtay in the inquiry of its Nature, O my Soul, be thou in the exerciſe of this <hi>Joy;</hi> Is there not cauſe? come ſee, and own thy Bleſſedneſs; take notice of the great things the Lord hath done for thee. As,— 1. He hath made a Covenant with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94897:62"/> thee of temporal mercies; thou haſt all thou haſt by free-holding of Covenant-Grace: thy Bread is by Covenant, thy ſleep is by Covenant, thy ſafety from Sword is by the Covenant, the very tilling of thy Land is by a Covenant of Grace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.34. O how ſweet is this? Every Crum is from Chriſt, and by virtue of a Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath made a Covenant with thee, of ſpiritual mercies; even a Covenant of Peace, and Grace, and Bleſſing, and Life for evermore; God is become thy God, he is all things to thee; he hath forgiven thy ſins, he hath given thee his Spirit, to lead thee, to ſanctifie thee, to uphold thee in that ſtate wherein thou ſtandeſt; and at laſt he will bring thee to a full enjoyment of himſelf in Glory, where thou ſhalt bleſs him, and rejoyce before him with joy unſpeakable and full of glory. O pluck up thy heart, lift up thy head, ſtrengthen the weak hands and the feeble knees; ſerve the Lord with gladneſs and joyfulneſs of Spirit, conſidering the day of thy Salvation draweth nigh. Write it in Letters of Gold, that <hi>thy God is in Covenant with thee, to love thee, to bleſs thee, and to ſave thee.</hi> Yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and receive thee to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then thou ſhalt fully know what it is to have God to be thy God, or to be in Covenant with God. I know theſe Objects rejoyce not every heart; a man out of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, if he look on God, he is a conſuming fire: if on the Law, it is a Sentence of Condemnation; if on the Earth, it brings forth Thorns by reaſon of ſins; if on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Gate is ſhut; if on the Signes in Heaven, Fire, Meteors, Thunder, ſtrike in him a terrour. But O my Soul, this is not thy caſe: a Man in Covenant with God, looks on theſe things with another eye; if he look on God, he ſaith, This is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if on Chriſt, this is my elder Brother; if on Angels, theſe are my Keepers; if on Heaven, this is my Houſe; if on the Signes of Heaven, Fire, Meteors, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, theſe are but the effects of my Fathers Power; if on the Law, the Son of God hath fulfilled it for me; if on Proſperity, God hath yet better things for me in ſtore; if on Adverſity, Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered much more for me than this; if on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Death, and Hell, he ſaith with the Apoſtle, <hi>O Death! where is thy Sting?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55.</note> 
                     <hi>O Grave! where is thy Victory?</hi> Come poor ſoul, is it not thus with thee? what? art thou in Covenant with God, or art thou not? If yet thou doubteſt, review thy grounds of hope, and leave not there, till thou comeſt up to ſome meaſure of aſſurance: but if thou art perſwaded of thy Intereſt, O then rejoyce therein; is it not a Goſpel-duty to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord, and again to rejoyce?</hi> The Lord is delighted in thy delights:<note place="margin">Phil. 4.4.</note> he would fain have it thy conſtant frame and daily buſineſs to live in joy, and to be alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting thy ſelf in him.</p>
                  <p>This one Promiſe, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> is enough to cauſe thy appetite to run to it, and to unite it ſelf to it by Love; and to ſcatter it ſelf on it, and to overflow thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Soul that are neareſt to it, that every part of the Soul may concur to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and all that is within me bleſs his holy Name.</hi> So rejoyce in the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, rejoyce in the Name of God. This is true joy, when the ſoul unites it ſelf to the good poſſeſſed in all its parts: And was there ever ſuch an object of true joy as this? Heark, as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven opened, and the voice came from God in Heaven; <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy Seed after thee: I am the Lord thy God; and I will be thy God.</hi> What? doth not thy heart leap in thy boſom at this ſound? <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt leaped in his mothers womb for joy, at the ſound of <hi>Maries</hi> Voice; and doth not thy ſoul ſpring within thee at this voice of God? O wonder! ſome can delight themſelves in ſin; and is not God better than ſin? Others more refined, and indeed ſanctified, can delight themſelves in remiſſion of Sin, in Grace, Pardon, Holineſs, Fore-thoughts of Heaven; how exceedingly have ſome gracious hearts been raviſhed with ſuch thoughts? But is not God, the objective happineſs, the Fountain-bleſſedneſs, more rejoycing than all theſe? Why? Dear ſoul if there be in thee any rejoycing faculty, now awake, and ſtir it up; it is <hi>the Lord thy God</hi> whom thou art to rejoyce in; it is he whom the glorious ſpirits joy in: it is he who is the top of Heavens joy, their exceeding joy: and it is he who is thy God as well as their God.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The forwardneſs of Chriſt, that gives to every one that asketh, according to his Promiſe.<note place="margin">John 4.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Hadſt thou but asked</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> VVoman) <hi>I would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94897:63"/> thee living water.</hi> Mark here the occaſion of Chriſt's, words; Chriſt being weary and thirſty by reaſon of his Journey, he asked of the Woman a Cup of water to drink; no great matter; he asks but a Cup of water, and the Woman ſtands at the Well-ſide where was water enough; yet ſhe gives not, but ſtands wondering that he being a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould ask water of her that was a <hi>Samaritan;</hi> well, ſaith Chriſt, thou denieſt me a Cup of cold water, being weary and thirſty, but hadſt thou asked of me, I would have given thee water of Life. Wonderful! Chriſt is more ready to give water of Life, the very Spirit of God, to a poor ſinnner, than we are to give a cup of common water to a thirſty Soul. Go then, thou that haſt denied the leaſt mercy and kindneſs to Chriſt in any of his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet ſeek Grace from him, <hi>O look up unto Jeſus!</hi> ask his Spirit, intreat him to make thy heart new within thee; plead the promiſe of his Covenant, and wait in hope.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 We muſt praiſe: 1.

                  <p n="9">9 WE muſt conform to Jeſus, in reference to this Covenant of Grace: <hi>We are changed by beholding, into the ſame Image.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> If we look unto Jeſus in this reſpect, this Look will have ſuch an influence upon us, that we ſhall conform to <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But wherein conſiſts this Conformity? I anſwer, in theſe ſeveral perticulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God in Chriſt offers his Covenant to us; ſo we through Chriſt ſhould embrace his Offer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God in Chriſt keeps Covenant with us; ſo we through <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be careful to keep Covenant with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God in Chriſt hath highly honoured us as we are his People: ſo we through <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould highly honour him as he is our God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God in Chriſt offers a Covenant of Grace to us; ſo we through Chriſt ſhould embrace this gracious Offer. His Offers have appeared from firſt to laſt: as, 1. <hi>To A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> 2. To <hi>Abraham.</hi> 3. To <hi>Moſes.</hi> 4. To <hi>David.</hi> 5. To <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to <hi>Judah.</hi> Take notice of it in that great promiſe of the Covenant, <hi>I will be thy</hi> God: q. d. <hi>Come Soul, if thou wilt but have me, I am thine, here I offer my ſelf, my ſon, my ſpirit, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Sanctification, Adoption, Salvation: whatſoever I am, or whatſoever I have, all is thine, if thou wilt but accept of me: Look over all this wide, wide world, and if there be any thing in it that can pleaſe thy ſoul; and when thou haſt gone through all the world, then come and take a view of me, and ſee me in my glory, beauty and excellency; view me in my Attributes, and ſee if thou findeſt not enough in me worthy of thy acceptance: all this, and more than this, nay more than eye can ſee, or ear can hear, or heart can conceive I offer to thee, if thou wilt but have me; Loe, I will he thy</hi> God. So Chriſtians! God is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94897:64"/> firſt with us, he is the firſt mover, he begins with us before we begin with him: <hi>I will bring them</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>into the bond of the Covenant.</hi> Now in this let us conform; doth he offer? O let us embrace the offer! doth he lead the way? O let us follow him ſtep by ſtep in that very way as he goes before us! Let us not preſcribe unto God, let not us preſume to appoint the Conditions of the Covenant; let us not ſeek to wind about the Promiſe of Grace to our own Mind and Will: let us not ſay, <hi>We will have it thus, thus and thus it ſhall be or elſe we will admit of no conditions of peace:</hi> But, O come, take God and Chriſt upon his own Terms; ſubmit to that way of the Covenant, and to thoſe conditions of peace which the Lord preſcribeth; why? this is to conform to his gracious offers. There is much of this offer of Chriſt and conforming to Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give me leave to enlarge. As in the offer God uſually ſcatters ſome little ſeeds of Faith in the hearts of thoſe that he will bring to himſelf; ſo it is worth the while to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the work of Faith in receiving and accepting of this gracious offer; only I ſhall not herein limit the Lord; but I will ſhew what ſome conceive the moſt uſual and ordinary courſe of Faiths working, and of the ſouls conforming to Jeſus Chriſt in its cloſing with Chriſt. As thus—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith hearing the great things propoſed in the Covenant of Grace, it ſtirs up in the heart a ſerious conſideration of their bleſſed condition, that are in covenant with <hi>God; Bleſſed art thou O Iſrael, a People ſaved by the Lord—What Nation in the Earth is like thy People,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 33.29. 2 Sam. 7.2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>even like Iſrael, whom God went to redeem for a People unto himſelf?</hi> Time was, (ſaith the Soul) that I counted the proud bleſſed, and the rich bleſſed, and the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bleſſed; time was when I placed my bleſſedneſs in other things, as in Riches, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, Favour, Credit with men; but now theſe are become vile, and things of no value; Faith makes us change our voice, and to ſpeak as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Bleſſed are the People whoſe</hi> God <hi>is the</hi> Lord.<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith ſtirs in the heart a longing deſire after this condition; good being believed, cannot but be deſired and longed for; Deſire naturally ſprings from the apprehenſion of any good being made known; hence Faith (we ſay) is both in the underſtanding and in the will; as it is in the underſtanding, it opens the eye to ſee, and clearly to diſcern the Bleſſing of the Covenant; as it is in the will, it purſues and deſires the attaining of the Grace revealed; nor are theſe deſires faint deſires, but very earneſt, eager, violent; ſometimes it is called <hi>a thirſting after</hi> God; and ſometimes <hi>a panting after</hi> God; and ſometimes <hi>a gaſping after</hi> God: it is ſuch a deſire as cannot be ſatisfied by any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith ſtirs in the heart ſome hope to enjoy this condition; I ſay <hi>ſome hope;</hi> for Faith being as yet in the Bud, or in the Seed, though its deſire be ſtrong, yet hope of obtaining is but feeble and weak; hence Faith is taken up with many thoughts: fain would the Soul be joyned to Chriſt, but being as yet diſmayed with the ſenſe of Sin, it ſtands like the Publican, afar off; as yet Faith can ſcarce ſpeak a word to God, only with <hi>Jonah,</hi> it can <hi>look towards his holy Temple.</hi> As a poor weak babe who lies in the Cradle ſick, and weak, and ſpeechleſs, only it can look towards the Mother for help; the caſt of the eye expreſſeth in ſome ſort what it would ſay; thus Faith being weak, it would ſpeak to God, but it cannot, or dares not; only it hath its eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven;<note place="margin">2 Chr. 20.12.</note> as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſometimes ſaid, <hi>Our eyes are towards thee.</hi> It feels a need, and fain would have; but ſenſe of unworthyneſs, and the ſenſe of the Law ſtrikes ſuch a fear into the heart, that it dares not come near. Conſider <hi>Iſraels</hi> Caſe, and we ſhall find it parallel to this: God proclaims on the Mount, <hi>I am the</hi> Lord <hi>thy</hi> God: what was this, but Gods offer to be in Covenant with <hi>Iſrael?</hi> and yet the terrour of the Thunder was ſo great, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> durſt not come near: a poor Soul hearing the Lord to offer himſelf to be in Covenant in him, <hi>Come ſoul, I am the</hi> Lord <hi>thy</hi> God. Why alas it dares not come near: <hi>What am I the Lord? or what is my Fathers Houſe, that I ſhould enter into a Covenant with the moſt high</hi> God? The Soul is unquiet within it ſelf, it is hurried to and fro, and finds no reſt; it hears of Peace with God, but feels it not; there is much ado with the Soul to ſuſtain its hope; only Faith ſets the mind again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to conſider the promiſes, invitati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, and all other incouragements which God hath given in his Word.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith ſtirs in the heart ſome reſolves to go to Gods Throne, and to ſue for Grace; Faith ſpeaks within as they did,<note place="margin">Jonah. 3.9. Amos. 5.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Who can tell whether the Lord will return?</hi> And, <hi>it may be the Lord</hi> God <hi>of Hoſts will be gracious to the remnant of Joſeph.</hi> So, <hi>Who can tell?</hi> ſaith the Soul; <hi>It may be the Lord will,</hi> ſaith the Soul: and this begets ſome reſolves
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94897:64"/> as thoſe Lepers in <hi>Samaria</hi> knew they were ſure to periſh, if they ſate ſtill; therefore they reſolved to try whether the <hi>Aramites</hi> would ſave them: Or as <hi>Eſther,</hi> knowing all was undone if ſhe would not ſtir, ſhe would try whether the King would hold out his Golden Scepter: So the poor Soul, knowing there is no way but periſhing, if it continue in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State, therefore it reſolves to go to <hi>God: Doth the</hi> Lord <hi>ſay, Seek my Face? Why,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 3.22.</note> 
                     <hi>thy Face</hi> Lord <hi>will I ſeek.—Doth the</hi> Lord <hi>ſay, Come unto Me? Why, Behold</hi> Lord, <hi>I come unto Thee; for Thou art the</hi> Lord <hi>our</hi> God. And now, the Soul betakes it ſelf unto <hi>God,</hi> it ſends up Complaints of it ſelf, it laments its own ſinful Rebellions, it puts out a whole Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Sighs, Groans, and ſtrong Cryes towards Heaven; it confeſſeth with Grief and bitter Mourning, all its former Iniquities; it ſmites, with Repenting <hi>Ephraim,</hi> upon its Thigh; it lyes down at <hi>God</hi>'s Foot-ſtool, it puts its Mouth in the Duſt; it acknowledgeth <hi>God</hi>'s Righteouſneſs if He ſhould condemn, and caſt off for ever; and yet withal, it pleads for Grace, that it may be accepted as one of His: It ſayes unto <hi>God;</hi> Lord, <hi>I have nothing to plead, why Thou may'ſt not Condemn me; but if Thou wilt receive me, Thy Mercy ſhall appear in me: O let Thy Mercy appear, take away all Iniquity, and receive me graciouſly.</hi> Thus the Soul lyes at <hi>God</hi>'s Throne, and pleads for Grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As Faith is thus earneſt in ſuing to <hi>God</hi> for Grace, ſo it is no leſs vigilant and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in obſerving what Anſwer comes from the <hi>Lord;</hi> even as the Priſoner at the Bar, not only cries for Mercy, but he marks every Word which falls from the Judges Mouth, if any thing may give him Hope; or as <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Servants lay at catch with the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſee if they could take occaſion by any thing which fell from him, to plead for the Life of <hi>Benhadad:</hi> So the poor Soul that is now pleading for Life and Grace, it watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth narrowly, to ſee if any thing may come from <hi>God,</hi> any Intimation of Favour, any Word of Comfort, that may tend to Peace. <hi>O let me hear Joy and Gladneſs.—I will hear what the</hi> Lord <hi>will ſay; for He will ſpeak Peace unto His People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. As Faith waits for an Anſwer, ſo accordingly it demeans it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes <hi>God</hi> anſwers not, and Faith takes on, and follows <hi>God</hi> ſtill, and cryes after Him with more Strength; as reſolving never to give over, till the <hi>Lord</hi> either ſave or deſtroy: Nay, if the <hi>Lord</hi> will deſtroy, Faith chuſeth to die at God's Feet; as when <hi>Joab</hi> was bidden to come forth from the Horns of the Altar, and to take his Death in another Place; <hi>Nay,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joab) but I will dye here:</hi> Or, as when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaw no Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance come in His Agony, <hi>He Prayed more earneſtly:</hi> So a poor Soul,<note place="margin">Luke 22.44.</note> in the Time of its Agony, when it is ſtriving as for Life and Death, if Help come not at firſt Call, it prayes again, and that more earneſtly. Faith is very urgent with God; and the more ſlack the <hi>Lord</hi> ſeems in anſwering, the more earneſt is Faith in plying God with its Prayers: It will wreſtle with God, as <hi>Jacob</hi> with the <hi>Angel;</hi> it will take no Denyal, but will crave ſtill: <hi>Bleſs me, even me alſo; O ſend me not away without a Bleſſing!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes God anſwers in part; He ſpeaks as it were out of a Dark Cloud; He gives ſome little Eaſe, but He ſpeaks not full Peace: In this manner He ſpeaks to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; <hi>Go thy way, and ſin no more:</hi> He doth not ſay; <hi>Go in Peace, thy Sin is forgiven thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 8.11.</note> No, no; but, <hi>Go thy way, and ſin no more.</hi> Hereby Faith uſually gets a little Strength, and looks after the <hi>Lord</hi> with more Hope; It begins to plead with God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; <hi>O</hi> Lord, <hi>Thou haſt begun to ſhew Grace unto Thy Servant; go on,</hi> Lord, <hi>to manifeſt unto me all Thy Goodneſs.</hi> Here Faith takes a little hold on the Covenant of Grace: It may be the Hand of Faith is feeble, ſhaking and trembling; yet it takes a little Hold, it receives ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, it finds that its former Seeking is not in vain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes God anſwers more fully and ſatisfactorily; He applyes ſome Promiſe of Grace to the Conſcience by His Spirit; He lets the Soul feel &amp; taſte the Comforts of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> or of ſuch and ſuch a Promiſe, more effectually than ever before: <hi>Fear not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 41.10.</note> (ſaith <hi>God) for I am thy God.</hi> Here Faith waxeth bold, and with a glad Heart entertains the Promiſe brought Home unto it. The Apoſtle calls this the <hi>Embracing of the Promiſes:</hi> Now,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Embracing</hi> implies an Affectionate Receiving with both Arms opened: So the Soul em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the Promiſe, and the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the Promiſe; and having Him, like <hi>Simeon,</hi> in his Arms, it layes Him in the Boſom, it brings Him into the Chamber of the Heart, there to reſt and abide for ever. And now is the Covenant ſtruck betwixt God, and the Soul: Now the Soul poſſeſſeth God in Chriſt, as her own; it reſts in Him, and is ſatisfyed with Him, it praiſeth God for <hi>his</hi> Mercy, as <hi>Simeon</hi> did, when he had Chriſt in his Arms; it commits it ſelf wholly, and for ever to that Goodneſs and Mercy, which hath been revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, Haſt thou come thus by little and little, to touch the Top of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Golden
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94897:65"/> Scepter? Why then, Is thy Hand given to <hi>God?</hi> Then art thou entred into a Covenant of Peace? <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Offering, and thy Receiving the Covenant of Grace, bears a ſweet A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, an harmonious Conformity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> keeps Covenant with us; ſo we through <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be careful and diligent to keep Covenant with <hi>God:</hi> In the Things of this Life, a ſtrict Eye is had to the Covenants we make. Now, it is not enough for us to enter into Covenant with <hi>God;</hi> but we muſt keep it: The <hi>Lord</hi> never will, never hath broken Covenants on His Part; but Alas! we on our Parts have broken the <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant of Works: Take heed we break not the <hi>ſecond;</hi> for then there remains not any more place for any more Covenants. As the <hi>Lord</hi> keeps Covenant with us; ſo let us keep Covenant with Him: and therein is the Bleſſing;<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>The Mercy of the</hi> Lord <hi>is from Everlaſting to Everlaſting,—to ſuch as keep his Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is much alſo in this keeping of the Covenant; and therefore, give me leave a little to enlarge. Sundry Acts of Faith are required to this keeping of the Covenant: As thus,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith in keeping the Covenant, hath alwayes an Eye to the Rule and Command of <hi>God:</hi> As in Things to be believed, Faith looks on the Promiſe; ſo in Things to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Faith looks upon the Command. Faith will preſent no ſtrange Fire before the <hi>Lord;</hi> it knows that God will accept of nothing, but what is according to His own Will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Faith takes Direction from the Rule; ſo in keeping of the Covenant, it directs us to the right End, that is, to the Glory of <hi>God.</hi> We are of Him, and live in Him; and by Faith we muſt live to Him,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.7, 8. 2 Cor. 5.15. Pſal. 50.15. Pſal. 86.12.</note> &amp; for Him: <hi>For none of us liveth to himſelf, and no Man dieth to himſelf; for whether we live, we live unto the</hi> Lord; <hi>&amp; whether we die, we die unto the</hi> Lord: <hi>whether we live therefore or die, we are the</hi> Lord's. Again, <hi>He died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto Him which died for them.</hi> This God claims as His right and due: <hi>Thou ſhalt glorifie Me,</hi> ſaith God: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaith Faith, <hi>I will glorifie thee for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith in keeping the Covenant, ſhields the Soul againſt all Hinderances that it meets withal: As for inſtance, Sometimes we are tempted on the Right Hand by the Baits and Allurements of the World; <hi>All theſe will I give thee,</hi> ſaith the World, <hi>if thou wilt be mine;</hi> but then <hi>Faith overcomes the World,</hi> by ſetting afore us better Things than theſe: Sometimes we are tempted on the Left Hand, by Croſſes, Afflictions, Perſecutions, and Sufferings for the Name of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but then Faith helps us to overcome, and makes us <hi>Conquerours through Chriſt that loved us,</hi> by ſetting before us the End of our Faith and Patience.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> It is ſaid of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> That <hi>for the Joy that was ſet before Him, He endured the Croſs and deſpiſed the Shame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith encourageth the Soul, that the <hi>Lord</hi> will have a Gracious Reſpect unto its keeping Covenant:<note place="margin">Acts 10.33.</note> 
                     <hi>In every Nation he that feareth Him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with Him.</hi> Surely this is no ſmall Encouragement to well-doing: What would not a Servant do, if he knew his Lord will take it in good part? Now, Faith aſſures the Soul, there is not one Prayer, one Holy Deſire, or one Good Thought, or Word which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or done to the Glory of <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> takes notice of it, and accepts it in good part. <hi>Then they that feared the</hi> Lord,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>ſpake often one to another; and the</hi> Lord <hi>hearkned, and heard it; and a Book of Remembrance was written before Him, for them that feared the</hi> Lord, <hi>and that thought upon His Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Faith furniſheth the Soul with Strength and Ability to keep the Covenant: By Faith we get a Power and Strength of Grace. As thus: —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Faith we look at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as having all Fulneſs of Grace in Himſelf; <hi>It pleaſed the Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1.19.</note> 
                     <hi>that in Him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell:</hi> All others have but their Meaſures, ſome more, ſome leſs, according to the Meaſure of the Gift of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath received the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.34.</note> 
                     <hi>not by Meaſure,</hi> but in the Fulneſs of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Faith we know, that whatever Fulneſs of Grace is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> He had it not for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only,<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.18. John 1.16.</note> but for us: <hi>He received Gifts for Men,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Pſalmiſt;</hi> not for Himſelf meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for Men: <hi>Of His Fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace,</hi> ſaith <hi>John:</hi> His Wiſdom to make us wiſe, His Meekneſs to make us meek, and His Patience to make us patient.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By Faith we look at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Faithful to diſtribute ſuch Grace unto us, as He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for us:<note place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note> 
                     <hi>He is Faithful in all the Houſe of God;</hi> He is Faithful in diſpenſing all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Grace committed unto Him, for His Churches Good: He keeps nothing back: His Faithfulneſs will not ſuffer Him to keep that to Himſelf, which He hath received for us.<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.18.</note> Hence as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>He received Gifts for Men;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle renders
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94897:65"/> it, <hi>He gave Gifts unto Men:</hi> As he receives, ſo he gives;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.8.</note> being faithful in all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By Faith we ſeek <hi>God,</hi> and beg Performance of his Promiſes according to our need: Do we want Wiſdom, Meekneſs, Patience, or any other Grace? Faith carries us by Prayer unto the Fountain, and in this way waits and expects to receive the Grace we want. As the Child by ſucking the Breaſt, draws forth Milk for its own Nouriſhment, and thereby it grows in Strength; ſo do we by the Prayer of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſuck from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from the Promiſe of Grace, and by that means derive Strength to our inner Man, to fulfil the Covenant which we have made with <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. As <hi>Faith</hi> ſtrengthens us; ſo if at any times, by occaſion or temptation, we fail in our Covenant-keeping, <hi>Faith</hi> recovers us, and reſtores us again to our former Eſtate: I do not ſay, the Covenant can be broken betwixt <hi>God</hi> and Us; we may offend God, and fail in the Service of God; but till we refuſe God, and leave God, and chuſe another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Lord, and Husband beſides <hi>God,</hi> there is no Diſſolution of the Covenant of Grace. Now, this a true Believer cannot do; He may fall, and fall often; yet he doth not fall, but he riſes again: he may turn aſide, but yet he returns again into the way of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. What a ſweet Point is this? Chriſtians, We may, and ſometimes we do walk weakly, in keeping of Covenants; our feet ſlip, and we ſtep aſide out of <hi>God</hi>'s Path; yet <hi>Faith</hi> brings us back again to <hi>God:</hi> It caſts Shame on our Faces, that after all the Grace ſhewed us, we ſhould ſo ill requite <hi>God:</hi> It reminds us of thoſe Promiſes, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto Me, and I will return unto you. —Ye have done all this Wickedneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 1.3. 1 Sam. 12.20, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>yet turn not aſide from following the</hi> Lord: — <hi>For the</hi> Lord <hi>will not forſake his People, for his Great Names ſake, becauſe it hath pleaſed the</hi> Lord <hi>to make you his People.</hi> In the minding of theſe, and ſuch other Promiſes, <hi>Faith</hi> doth encourage us to return unto <hi>God,</hi> to take words unto our ſelves, and to plead the Covenant of his Grace towards us: This VVork of <hi>Faith</hi> brought <hi>Peter</hi> back to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whereas <hi>Judas</hi> wanting this <hi>Faith,</hi> lies down in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Sorrow, never able to riſe up, or to recover himſelf.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul! Art thou acquainted with theſe Acts of <hi>Faith,</hi> enabling thee in ſome good meaſure to keep Covenant with God? Then is there a ſweet Conformity betwixt Thee, and <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath highly honoured us, as we are his People; ſo we through <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould honour <hi>Him</hi> highly, as <hi>He</hi> is our <hi>God:</hi> This is the main End of the Covenant; and I ſhall end with this: O my Soul, be like to God, bear the Image and Reſemblance of God thy Father, in this Reſpect: He hath humbled <hi>Himſelf</hi> to advance <hi>thee;</hi> O then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelf to advance <hi>Him;</hi> endeavour every way to exalt <hi>his</hi> Name.</p>
                  <p>We are willing to be in Covenant with God, that we may ſet up our ſelves, that we may ſit upon Thrones, and poſſeſs a Kingdom: But we muſt think eſpecially of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the <hi>Lord</hi> upon his Throne: <hi>Aſcribe Greatneſs to our God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 32.3.</note> make it a Name, and a Praiſe unto <hi>Him,</hi> that he hath vouchſafed to make us his People, and to take us into Covenant with <hi>Himſelf:</hi> Honour <hi>Him</hi> as <hi>he</hi> is <hi>God;</hi> but honour <hi>Him</hi> more abundantly, as <hi>he</hi> is our <hi>God:</hi> Who ſhould Honour <hi>Him,</hi> if <hi>his</hi> People will not? The World knows <hi>Him</hi> not; <hi>The Wicked will not ſeek after God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 10.4,</note> — <hi>God is not in all his Thoughts.</hi> And, Shall <hi>God</hi> have no Honour? Shall <hi>He</hi> that ſtretched out the Heavens, and laid the Foundations of the Earth, and formed Man upon it, have no Glory? O yes! The <hi>Lord</hi> Himſelf anſwers; <hi>This People have I formed for My Self,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 43.21.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſhall ſhew forth My Praiſe:</hi> Surely, God will have Praiſe from <hi>his</hi> own People, whom <hi>he</hi> hath taken unto <hi>Himſelf: He will be glorifyed in all thoſe that come near Him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But, How ſhould we honour <hi>God?</hi> I anſwer: —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt ſet <hi>Him</hi> up as chief and higheſt in our Eſteem: Kings acount not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves honoured, if they be not ſet above other Men: And hence God's People have uſed ſuch Expreſſions concerning God, as do ſingle Him forth beyond the Compariſon of all Creatures. Thus <hi>Moſes; Who is like unto Thee amongſt the Gods? Who is like unto Thee,</hi>

                     <hi>there is no</hi> God <hi>like unto Thee in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath; who keepeſt Covenant and Mercy with Thy Servants?</hi> Thus <hi>Micah; Who is a</hi> God <hi>like unto Thee,</hi>

                     <hi>which paſſeſt by the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the Remnant of thine Heritage?</hi> And thus ſhould we riſe up in our Thoughts and Apprehenſions of <hi>God,</hi> until we come to an Holy Extaſie and Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:94897:66"/>2. We muſt count it our Bleſſedneſs, and higheſt Dignity, to be a People in Covenant with <hi>God:</hi> Are we Honourable? Yet eſteem this as our greateſt Honour, that God is our God: Are we low and deſpiſed in the World? Yet count this Honour enough, that God hath lifted us up to be his People. Chriſtians, if when we are counted as things of nought, we can quiet our ſelves in this, that <hi>God is our God;</hi> if when we are perſecuted, impriſoned, diſtreſſed, we can ſay with <hi>Jacob, I have enough, becauſe the</hi> Lord <hi>hath Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me, and hath taken me into Covenant with Him:</hi> ſurely then we do bear Witneſs of God before Heaven and Earth, that He is better to us than Corn, or Wine, or Oyl, or whatſoever this World affords.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt lie under the Authority of every Word of God, and we muſt conform our ſelves to the Examples of God; that is, we muſt labour to become Followers of God, and imitate <hi>his</hi> Virtues. It is a part of that Honour which Children owe to their Parents, to obey their Commands, and to imitate their Godly Example: we cannot honour God more, than when we are <hi>Humbled at his Feet to receive his Word,</hi> than when we renounce the Manners of the <hi>world,</hi>

Now in all the Tranſactions of this Time, we ſhall eſpecially handle theſe: 1. The Tidings of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 2. The Conception of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. The Duplicity of Natures in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 4.

And as this Name is exalted above all Names; ſo are we to exalt his Mercy above all his Works. O it is an uſeful Name! In all Depths, Diſtreſſes, Miſeries, Perplexities, we beſeech God by the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to make good his own Name, not to bear it for nought; but as He is a Saviour, ſo to ſave us: And this is our Comfort, that God will never ſo remember our wretched Sins, as to forget His own Bleſſed Name; and eſpecially this Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> O it is the Higheſt, the Deareſt, the Sweeteſt Name to us of all the Names of <hi>God.</hi>

Alas, alas! <hi>Sin</hi> (if we underſtand) is the very worſt of Evils: There is no Poverty but Sin, there is no Shame but Sin, there is no Plague to that of Sin; there is no Priſon, but that Priſon is a Paradiſe without Sin; there is no Death that hath any Sting in it, but for Sin; <hi>The Sting of Death is Sin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; take out the <hi>Sting,</hi>

                  <p>But, Is not <hi>Chriſt</hi> as precious a Name as <hi>Jeſus</hi> is?

                  <p n="2">2. THe Conception of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was the Concluſion of the <hi>Angel</hi>'s Meſſage: No ſooner had the <hi>Virgin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Be it to me according to Thy Word;</hi> but according to that <hi>Word</hi> it was: immediately the Holy Ghoſt over-ſhadowed her, and Forms our <hi>Saviour</hi> in her Womb. Now Chriſtians! Now was the Time of Love; eſpecially, if we relate to His Conception and Birth: Well may we ſay, Now was it that the Day brake up, that the Sun aroſe, that Darkneſs vaniſhed, that Wrath and Anger gave place to Favour and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94897:68"/> Now was it, that <hi>Free-Grace</hi> came down from Heaven, Thouſands of Angels waiting on her; the very Clouds part (as it were) to give her way; the Earth ſprings to welcom her; the Flouds clap their Hands for Joy; the Heavenly Hoſts ſing as ſhe goes along, <hi>Glory to</hi> God <hi>in the Higheſt, Peace upon Earth, Good Will towards Men:</hi> Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs go before her, Peace and Proſperity follow after her, Pity and Mercy waits on either Hand; and when ſhe firſt ſets Foot on the Earth, ſhe cryes a <hi>Jeſus, a Saviour!

                  <p>But in this Conception of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are ſo many Wonders, that e're we begin to ſpeak them,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> we may ſtand amazed: <hi>Without Controverſie, great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs; God manifeſted in the Fleſh.</hi> Say, Is it not a Wonder, a Myſtery, a great Myſtery, a great Myſtery without all Controverſie, that the Son of God ſhould be made of a Woman, even made of that Woman which was made by Himſelf? Is it not a Wonder, that her Womb <hi>then,</hi> and that the Heavens <hi>now,</hi> ſhould contain Him, whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain? Concerning this Conception of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak a little, and but a little: What Man can conceive much of this Conception, which was a Conception without Help of Man?<note place="margin">Luke 1.35.</note> Our greateſt Light we borrow from the <hi>Angel,</hi> who deſcribes it thus; <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the Higheſt ſhall over-ſhadow thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of theſe Words, obſerve, 1. The Agent or Efficient. 2. The Fruit or Effect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Agent or Efficient Cauſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Conception, is the Holy-Ghoſt. This agrees with that Speech of the <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Joſeph;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 1.20.</note> 
                     <hi>That which is Conceived in her, is of the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Here it may be demanded, why the Conception of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be aſcribed to the Holy-Ghoſt, which is common to all the Actions in the <hi>Trinity?</hi> I anſwer, Not to exclude the reſt; but firſt, to ſhew it was the free Grace of <hi>God,</hi> which is often termed <hi>the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> 2. Becauſe the Father and the Son effected it by the Holy-Ghoſt, ſo was it his Work immediately, and in a ſpecial manner: Good reaſon have we to be thankful to all the Three Perſons; to the Father, for ordaining this Garment; to the Holy-Ghoſt, for weaving it; to the Son, for wearing it; to the whole Deity, for cloathing us with it, and making us Righteous by it —Neither yet is the Holy-Ghoſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Father; he did not beget Him, he did not form Him, he did not miniſter Matter from his own Subſtance whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made; but took a part of Humane Nature from the Virgin, and of that he made the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within her. Away with all groſs Opinions, and old Hereſies! This Conception of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not by any Carnal Effuſion of Seminal Humour; but by way of Manufacture, <hi>(i.)</hi> by Handy-work, or Operation, or Virtue of the Holy-Ghoſt; or elſe by the Energetical Command and Ordination of the Holy-Ghoſt, whereby that part of the <hi>Virgin's</hi> Blood, or Seed, whereof the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be framed, was ſo cleanſed and ſanctified, that in it there ſhould be neither Spot nor Stain of Original Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Fruit or Effect was the Framing of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Manhood, in which we may obſerve the Matter and Manner. 1. For the Matter: Obſerve we the Matter of the Body, and of the Soul of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 1. The Matter of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it was the very Fleſh and Blood of the <hi>Virgin: He was made of Woman,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>(i.)</hi> of the Fleſh and Blood,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4. Rom. 1.6.</note> &amp; Subſtance of the Woman: <hi>And He was made of the Seed of</hi> David (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>according to the Fleſh,</hi> otherwiſe He could not have been the Son of <hi>David,</hi> according to the Fleſh: And, if it be true which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, That <hi>the Seed of the Man doth not fall into the Subſtance of the Child, but only doth diſpoſe the Seed of the Woman, (as a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frameth and diſpoſeth his Work) to make the ſame into the Form of a Man:</hi> Why then, I know not wherein the Conception of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould differ in the Matter at all from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; ſave only in the Agent, or Worker of his Subſtance, who was the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> 2. The Matter or Subſtance of the Soul of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was not derived from the Soul of the Virgin, as a part thereof; but it was made as the Souls of other Men be, <hi>(i.)</hi> of nothing, by the Power of <hi>God;</hi> and ſo infuſed into the Body by the Hand of <hi>God:</hi> But of theſe Things (of His Body and Soul, and Humane Nature) we ſhall ſpeak more largely in the next <hi>Section.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:94897:68"/>2. For the manner of forming Chriſts humane Nature, it was miraculous. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel aſcribes two actions to the Holy Ghoſt in this great work; the one to <hi>come upon</hi> the Virgin, the other to <hi>overſhadow</hi> her; by the firſt is ſignified the extraordinary work of the Holy Ghoſt in faſhioning the humane Nature of Chriſt; as it was ſaid of <hi>Sampſon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 14.6.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord came upon him, (i.e.)</hi> the Holy Ghoſt inſpired him with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtrength; ſo the Spirit of the Lord came upon her <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the holy Ghoſt wrought in her in an extraordinary way. As for inſtance; in ordinary generation our ſubſtance and parts are framed ſucceſſively by degrees, as firſt, the ſeminal humour becomes an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo, then a body in organical; then are faſhioned the Liver, Heart, and Brain, and then the reſt one after another? and it is at leaſt forty days before the body of a Child be fully formed: now it was otherwiſe with the Body of Chriſt; for in the very inſtant of his conception, he was made perfect in Body and Soul, void of Sin, and full of Grace; in the very inſtant of his Conception he was perfectly framed, and inſtantly united unto the eternal Word, perfect God and perfect Man. Surely this was extraordinary, and this is the property of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>ſubito operari,</hi> to work inſtantly and perfectly; <hi>as ſoon as ever the fleſh was conceived, it was preſently united,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug'l De fido ad <hi>Pet. c. 18.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and made the fleſh of the Son of</hi> God; it was ſuddenly made, perfectly made, holily made.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond action aſcribed to the holy Ghoſt, is adumbration, or <hi>overſhadowing</hi> of the Virgin; this teacheth us that we ſhould not ſearch overmuch into this great Myſtery. Alas it is to high for us; if the courſe of ordinary generation be a ſecret, how paſt all comprehenſion, is this extraordinary operation? the holy Ghoſt did caſt a ſhadow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Virgin, and withall a ſhadow over this Myſtery? why ſhould we ſeek a clear light where God himſelf will have a ſhadow?<note place="margin">Chryſ. hom. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>I know the Word was made fleſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome) but how he was made I know not.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The firſt man is of the earth, earthy: the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven. — heavenly.</hi> I anſwer, 1.

This holds forth that Chriſt alſo was in ſome ſort heavenly, or from heaven in his humane nature, in that the humane nature was united to the divine, and withal in that the humane nature was formed by the holy Ghoſt; ſo <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm is ſaid to be from heaven: though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor the water wherewith he Baptized, deſcended from heaven: but becauſe he received it from God who is in heaven. Chriſt was conceived (as you heard) by the Holy Ghoſt, and in that regard his generation was divine and <hi>heavenly,</hi> or from <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In way of comfort and incouragement, Chriſt was thus conceived that he might <label type="milestone">

O that he would run through the Contumelies of our fordid Nature; that he would nor refuſe that which we our ſelves in ſome ſort are aſhamed of! Some think it a reaſon why the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and ſome others run into ſuch Fancies, and deny this Conception of Chriſt, only to decline thoſe ſoul indignities (as they take them) for the great God of heaven to undergo: but certainly this was for us, and for our ſakes; and therefore far be it from us to honour him the leſs, becauſe he laid down his honour for our ſakes; no, no, let us honour him more, and love him more; the lower he came for us, the dearer and dearer let him be unto us: conſider in all theſe tranſactions Chriſt was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the great work of our ſalvation, otherwiſe he had never been conceived, never had aſſumed to his Perſon humane Nature, never had been Man.</p>

                  <p>And 1. That Chriſt is true God, both apparent <hi>ſcriptures,</hi> and unanſwerable Reaſons drawn from <hi>ſcriptures,</hi> do plainly evince.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>ſcriptures</hi> call him God. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. From theſe Relations he hath with God, as to be the only begotten Son of

                  <p n="3">3. From thoſe Acts aſcribed to him which are only agreeable to the divine Nature; as, to be the Author of our Election, <hi>John</hi> 13.18. To know the Secrets of our Hearts, <hi>Ma.</hi> 9.4. To hear the prayers of his people, <hi>John</hi> 14.14. To judge the quick and the dead, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. And thus he creates as God, <hi>John</hi> 1.4. He commands as God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26. He forgives as God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.6. He ſanctifies as God, <hi>John</hi> 1.12.

He is adored as God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. Surely all theſe are ſtrong demonſtrations, and prove clearly enough, that Chriſt Jeſus is God. But why was it requiſite that our Saviour ſhould be God? I anſwer, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none can ſave Souls, nor ſatisfie for ſin, but God alone; <hi>There is none</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that can by any means redeem his Brother, or give a ranſom for him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.7.15.</note> — <hi>but God will redeem my ſoul from the power of Hell.</hi> 2. Becauſe the ſatisfaction which is made for ſin, muſt be infinitely meritorious: an infinite wrath cannot be appeaſed, but by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite merit; and hence our Saviour muſt needs be God, to the end, that his obedience and ſufferings might be of infinite price and worth — 3 Becauſe the burden of God's wrath cannot be endured, and run through by a finite Creature: Chriſt therefore muſt be God, that he might abide the burden, and ſuſtain the Manhood by his divine power. 4. Becauſe the enemies of our ſalvation were too ſtrong for us: How could any creature overcome Satan, Death, Hell, Damnation? Ah! this required the power of God; there's none but God that could deſtroy <hi>him that had the power of death, that is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Chriſt is God, ſo he is true man; he was born as man, and bred as man, and fed as man, and ſlept as man, and wept as man, and ſorrowed as man, and ſuffered as man, and died as man; and therefore he is man.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly. 1. Chriſt had a humane body;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Wherefore when he came into the world, he ſaid, Sacrifice and Offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> And when the Apoſtles thought they had ſeen a Phantaſm, or a Spirit, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Handle me and ſee, becauſe a Spirit hath no fleſh and bones, as you ſee me have.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.39.</note> Here's a truth clear as the Son; and yet, O wonder! Some in our times (as <hi>Cochlaeus</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) do now avouch, that he had but an imaginary body, an aerial body, a phantaſm, only in ſhew, and no true body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt had an humane reaſonable Soul. <hi>My Soul is heavy unto Death,</hi> ſaid Chriſt;<note place="margin">Mat. 26.38. Luke 23.46.</note> and again, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</hi> Surely (ſaith <hi>Nazianzen) either he had a Soul, or he will not ſave a Soul.</hi> The <hi>Arrians</hi> oppoſed this, ſaying, <hi>Chriſt had no humane Soul, but only a living fleſh;</hi> becauſe the Evangeliſt ſaith that <hi>the Word was made fleſh;</hi> but this is a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 1.14.</note> very uſual in Scripture, to put the part for the whole; and ſignifieth as much as that he had ſaid, <hi>the Word was made man.</hi> I know ſome reaſons are rendred why the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>he was made fleſh,</hi> rather than <hi>he was made man;</hi> as, 1. To ſhew what part of Chriſt was made of his Mother; not his Deity, nor his Soul, but only his fleſh. 2. To expreſs the greatneſs of Gods Love, who for our ſakes would be contented to be made the vileſt thing, <hi>fleſh,</hi> which is compared to graſs.<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.6.</note> 
                     <hi>All fleſh is graſs.</hi> 3. To ſhew the greatneſs of Chirſts humility, in that he would be named by the meaneſt name, and baſeſt part of man; the ſoul is excellent, but the fleſh is baſe. 4. To give us ſome confidence of his love and favour towards us, becauſe our fleſh, which was the part moſt corrupted, is now united to the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt had all the properties that belong either to the ſoul or body of a man: nay more than ſo, Chriſt had all the infirmities of out Nature, ſin only excepted: I ſay the infirmities of our nature, as cold, and heat, and hunger, and thirſt, and wearineſs, and weakneſs, and pain, and the like; but I cannot ſay that Chriſt took upon him all our perſonal infirmities; infirmities are either natural, common to all men, or perſonal; and proper to ſome men; as to be born lame, blind, diſeaſed; as to be affected with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, Infirmity, Deformity: how many deformed Creatures have we amongſt us? Chriſt was not thus; his Body was framed by the holy Ghoſt of the pureſt Virgins Blood; and therefore I queſtion not, it was proportioned in a moſt equal ſymetry, and correſpondency of parts; <hi>He was fairer than the ſons of men;</hi> his countenance car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in it <hi>an hidden vailed ſtar — like brightneſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jerome) which being but a little
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94897:70"/> revealed, it ſo raviſhed his Diſciples hearts, that at the firſt ſight thereof they left all, and followed him: and it ſo aſtoniſhed his enemies, that they ſtumbled and fell to the ground.</hi> So then he had not our perſonal infirmities, but only our natural; and good reaſon, for indeed he took not upon him an humane perſon, but only an humane nature united to the perſon of his Godhead.</p>
                  <p>But why was it requiſite that our Saviour ſhould be Man? I anſwer, 1. Becauſe our Saviour muſt ſuffer and die for our ſins, which the Godhead could not do. 2. Becauſe our Saviour muſt perform obedience to the Law, which was not agreeable to the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver; the Godhead certainly is free from all manner of ſubjection. 3. Becauſe our Saviour muſt ſatisfie the juſtice of God in the ſame nature wherein it was offended; <hi>For ſince by man came death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5 21.</note> 
                     <hi>by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> 4. Becauſe <hi>by this means we might have free acceſs to the Throne of Grace, and might find help in our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, having ſuch an High-Prieſt as was in all things tempted like unto us, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our infirmities in his own perſon,</hi> Heb. 4.15. — 5.2.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="4">4. A Real diſtinction of theſe two Natures is evident. 1. In regard of eſſence, the Godhead cannot be Manhood, nor can the Manhood be the Godhead. 2. In regard of proprieties, the Godhead is moſt wiſe, juſt, omnipotent, yea wiſdom, juſtice, omnipotency it ſelf, and ſo is not the Manhood, neither can it be. 3. They have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Wills;<note place="margin">Luke 22.42.</note> 
                     <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done, O Father!</hi> Plainly differencing the Will of a Creature, from the Will of a Creator. 4. The very actions in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption are indeed inſeparable,<note place="margin">John. 10.18.</note> and yet diſtinguiſhable; <hi>I lay down my life, and take it up again:</hi> to lay it down was the action of man, not of God; and to take it up, was the action of God, not of man; in theſe reſpects we ſay each nature remains in it ſelf entire, without any converſion, compoſition, commixtion, or confuſion: there is no converſion of one into the other, as when he changed water into wine; no compoſition of both, no abolition of either, no confuſion at all. It is eaſy to obſerve this real di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of his two natures from firſt to laſt; as firſt, He was conceived as others, and ſo he was man; but he was conceived by the holy Ghoſt, as never man was; and ſo he is God. 2. He was born as others, and ſo he was man; but he was born of a Virgin, as never man was; and this ſpeaks him a God. 3. He was crucified, died, and was buried, and ſo he was man; but he roſe again from the dead, aſcended into Heaven, and from thence ſhall come at laſt to judge the quick and the dead, and ſo he is God.— Or if from the Apoſtles Symbol we go to the Goſpel, which ſpeaks both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at large; we find there, 1. He was born of his Mother, and wrapped in ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-clouts, as being a man; but the Star ſhines over him, and the wiſe men adore him, as being a God. 2. He was Baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> as being a man; but the holy Ghoſt from heaven deſcended upon him, as being a God. 3. He is tempted of Satan; as being a man; but he overcame Satan, and diſpoſſeſſed Devils, as being a God. 4. He tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and was thirſty, and hungry, and weary, as being a man; but he refreſhed the weary, and fed the hungry, and gave drink, even water of life to the thirſty, as being a God. 5. He ſlept in the Ship, and his Diſciples awoke him, as being a man; but he rebuked the winds, and ſtilled the raging of the tumultuous Seas, as being a God. 6. He was poor and needy, had not an houſe to put his head in, as being a man; but he was, and is rich and mighty, and cannot be contained in the heaven of heavens, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a God. 7. He was ſorrowful and ſad, he wept and he prayed, as being a man; but he comforts the ſorrowful, and heareth the prayers of all his Saints, as being a God. 8. He was whipped, and rent, and torn, and crucified, as being a man: but he rent the vail of the Temple, and cauſed the Sun to hide his face for ſhame, when he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as being a God. 9. He cried out on the Croſs, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, lamaſabacthani,</hi> as being a man; but he could ſay to the Thief, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> as being a God. 10. He died and was buried, and lay in the grave, as being a man; but he overcame death, and deſtroyed the Devil, and raiſed up himſelf to life again, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a God. 11. After his Reſurrection he appeared to his Diſciples, and ate with them, and talked with them, as being a man; but he provided meat, and vaniſhed out of their ſight, as being a God. 12. He aſcended into heaven, and the heavens now contain him,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94897:70"/> as he is Man; but he ſuſtains the Heavens, and commands all therein, and rides on the ſame, as being a God. Thus we ſee all along two real diſtinct natures ſtill continuing in Chriſt; God being become Man, the Deity being aboliſhed, but the humane nature was adjoyned; according to the old Diſtich, <hi>Sum quod eram, nec eram quod ſum,</hi> &amp;c. I am that I was, but I was not that I am. You will ſay, How then is it ſaid <hi>the word was made fleſh,</hi> or God became Man? I anſwer, one thing may become another either by way of change, as when the water was turned into wine; but thus was not Chriſt: the Godhead was for a time concealed, but it was never cancelled: or one thing may become another either by way of union, as when one ſubſtance is adjoyned unto another, and yet is not transferred or changed into the nature of the other; thus a Souldier putting on his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, is an armed man; or a man wearing on his Garments, is no more a naked, but a cloathed man; and yet the Armour and the Souldier, the man and his Apparel are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct things: and thus was it with Chriſt; the fleſh is ſaid to be deified, and the Deity is ſaid to be incarnate; not by the converſion of either into the nature of the other, but by aſſuming, and adjoyning the humane nature to the divine; and yet ſtill the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the divine are diſtinct things; both the natures in Chriſt do remain entire, and inconfuſed; indeed the humanity is much magnified by the divinity; but the divinity is nothing altered by the humanity: Thus much for the diſtinction of his two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

It is a great myſtery, a ſecret, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; many wonders have been ſince the beginning of the world; but all the wonders that ever were, muſt give place to this, and in reſpect thereof, ceaſe to be wonderful: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Creation of all things out of nothing, nor the reſtauration of all things into their perfect being; I mean neither the firſt work, nor the laſt work of God in this world (though moſt admirable pieces) may be compared with this.

                  <p>In the explication of this union, that which I ſhall inſiſt on (as the moſt neceſſary for our underſtanding) is, 1. The Union it ſelf. 2. The Effects, or Benefits of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Union it ſelf we ſhall diſcuſs, 1. Of the ſorts of Union, and of what ſort this is. 2. Of the very thing it ſelf, wherein this union conſiſts. 3. Of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Texts that confirm this union. 4. Of the ſimilitudes that hold ſorth this union. 5. Of the perſon aſſuming; and of the nature aſſumed; and of the reaſon of this way. And of theſe, as briefly as I may: I would rather ſay much in a little, than a little in much.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Union is of divers ſorts, as natural and myſtical, accidental and ſubſtantial, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and integral. But I ſhall paſs theſe by; and ſpeak only of theſe ſorts. 1. When one of the things united is turned into the other; as when a drop of water is poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a veſſel of Wine. 2. When both the things united are changed in nature and eſſence; as when the Elements are united, to make mixt or compounded bodies. 3. When there is no change of things united, but the conſtitution of a third nature out of them both, as is the union of the ſoul and body. 4. When there is neither a change of natures u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, nor conſtitution of a third out of them both; but only the founding, ſetling, and ſtaying of the one of the things united in the other, and the drawing of it into the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the perſonal being, or ſubſiſtence of the other: ſo the Branch of a Tree being put upon the ſtock of another Tree, it is drawn into the unity of the ſubſiſtence of that Tree into which it is put: and whereas if it had been ſet in the Ground, it would have grown as a ſeparate Tree in it ſelf; now it groweth in the Tree into which it is graffed, and pertaineth to the unity of it: and this kind of union doth, of all others, moſt perfectly reſemble the perſonal union of the two Natures of God, and man in Chriſt; wherein the nature of man, that would have been a perſon in it ſelf, if it had been left to it ſelf, is drawn into the unity of the divine perſon, and ſubſiſteth in it, being prevented from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in it ſelf, by this perſonal union and aſſumption.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the thing wherein this union of two natures conſiſts; we ſay that this union conſiſts in that dependance of the humane nature on the perſon <hi>of the Word,</hi> and in that communicating of the perſon, or ſubſtance of <hi>the Word,</hi> with the humane nature that is aſſumed; ſo that it is an hypoſtatical or perſonal union; that is, ſuch an union as that both natures do make but one perſon of Chriſt: for the better underſtanding of this, we muſt conſider what the difference is betwixt <hi>Nature and Perſon,</hi> and what makes an individual <hi>Nature</hi> to be a <hi>Perſon:</hi> briefly thus; <hi>To be this or that, we ſay, is an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual nature; to be this or that, in or for it ſelf, is a perſon or ſubſiſtence; to be this or that, in or for another, is to pertain to the perſon or ſubſiſtence of another.</hi> Now amongſt thoſe created things which are naturally apt to make a perſonal being, or to ſubſiſt in and for themſelves, there is a very great difference: for,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some things of this kind may become parts of another more entire thing of the ſame kind: as we ſee in all thoſe things wherein every part hath the ſame nature that the whole hath; as every drop of water is water, and being leſt to it ſelf, it is a ſubſiſtence in it ſelf, and hath its quality, nature, and being in, and for it ſelf; but if it be joyned to a greater quantity of water, it hath now no being, quantity, nor operation, but in and for that greater quantity of water, into which it is poured.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other things of this kind cannot naturally put themſelves into the unity of any other thing; and yet by the help of ſome forreign cauſe they may be united; as the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94897:71"/> branch of a Tree of one kind (which put into the ground, would be an intire, diſtinct Tree in it ſelf) may by the hand of a man be put into the unity of a Tree of another kind; and ſo grow, move, and bear fruit, not diſtinctly in and for it ſelf, but jointly in and for that Tree into which it is planted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Other things of this kind cannot by force of natural cauſes, nor by the help of any forreign thing, ever become parts of any other created thing or pertain to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſubſtance of any ſuch thing; as the nature of man, and the nature of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things; and yet by divine and ſupernatural working, it may be drawn into the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſubſiſtence of any of the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, wherein the fulneſs of all being, and the Perfection of all created things, is in a more eminent ſort than in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for though all created things have their own being, yet ſeeing God is nearer to them than they are to themſelves, and they are in a better fort in him than they are in themſelves, there is no queſtion but that they may be prevented and ſtaid from being in and for themſelves, and cauſed to be in, and for one of the divine perſons of the bleſſed Trinity.</p>
                  <p>So that as one drop of water, that formerly ſubſiſted in it ſelf, if it be poured into a veſſel containing a greater quantity, it becomes one in ſubſiſtence with the greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water; and as a branch of a Tree, that being ſet in the ground, and left to it ſelf, would be an intire and independant <hi>tree,</hi> becomes one in ſubſiſtence with that <hi>tree</hi> into which it is grafted; ſo the individual nature of man aſſumed into the unity of one of the Perſons of the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> it looſeth that kind of being, that naturally left to it ſelf, it would have had, and it becomes one with the Perſon; for now it is not in, and for it ſelf, but hath got a new Relation of dependance and being in another.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, all the Creatures in the world have their being in God, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God; and therefore all Creatures, as well as Man, may pertain to the Perſon, or Subſiſtence of God.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, it is not a general being in, and depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce on God, but a ſtrict depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on mans part, and a Communicating of the ſubſiſtence on Gods part that makes up this union. Hence we ſay that there are four degrees of the preſence of God in his Creatures; the firſt is his general preſence, whereby he preſerves the ſubſtances of all Creatures, and gives unto them <hi>to live, and to move, and to have their being;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts. 7.28.</note> and this extends it ſelf to all Creatures good and bad.</p>
                  <p>The Second degree is the preſence of Grace, whereby he doth not only preſerve the ſubſtance of his Creature, but alſo gives Grace unto it; and this agrees to the Saints and Gods People on earth. The third degree is the preſence of glory peculiar to the Saints and Angels in heaven, and hereby God doth not only preſerve their ſubſtances, and give them plenty of his Grace, but he alſo admits them into his Glorious preſence, ſo as they may behold him face to face. The fourth and laſt degree is that whereby the God-Head of the Son is preſent with, and dwells in the Manhood, giving unto it in ſome part his own ſubſiſtence, whereby it comes to paſs that this Manhood aſſumed is proper to the Son, and cannot be the Manhood of the Father, or of the Holy Ghoſt, or of any Creature whatſoever. And this is a thing ſo admirable and unſpeakable, that though we may find ſome ſimilitudes, yet there cannot be found another example hereof in all the World.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows that in the Manhood of Chriſt, conſiſting of Body and Soul, there is a Nature only, and not a Perſon; becauſe it doth not ſubſiſt alone as other men, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> do, but it wholly depends on the Perſon of <hi>the Word</hi> into the unity whereof it is received; and this dependance of the humane nature on the perſon of <hi>the Word,</hi> and the communicating of the Perſon or ſubſiſtence of <hi>the Word</hi> with the humane nature, is the very thing it ſelf wherein this union conſiſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Scriptural texts that confirm this Union, you ſee the Well is very deep; but where is the Bucket? What texts of Scripture have we to confirm this wonderful Union of two Natures in one Perſon? Amongſt many I ſhall only cite theſe;<note place="margin">Mat. 16.13, 16.</note> —</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt asked his Apoſtles, <hi>Whom do men ſay that I the Son of man am? — Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter anſwered, Thou art the Chriſt the Son of the living God:</hi> Now, if but one Chriſt, then ſurely but one Perſon; and if the Son of man be the Son of the Living God, then ſurely there are two natures in that one Perſon: Obſerve how the Son of man, and the Son of God, very Man and very God, concenter in Chriſt: as the Soul and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy make but one man, ſo the Son of man and the Son of God make but one Chriſt:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.3, 4.</note>

Obſerve the paſſages; he in whom that fulneſs dwells, is the Perſon; that <hi>fulneſs,</hi> which doth ſo dwell in him, is the Nature; now there dwells in him not only the fulneſs of the Godhead, but the fulneſs of the Manhood alſo; for we believe him to be both perfect God, begotten of the ſubſtance of his Father before all Worlds; and perfect man, made of the ſubſtance of this Mother in this World; only he in whom the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth, is one; and he in whom the fulneſs of the Manhood dwelleth, is another; but he in whom the fulneſs of both theſe natures dwelleth, is one and the ſame <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and conſequently one and the ſame perſon; in him, <hi>(i.)</hi> in his perſon dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead, and all the fulneſs of the Manhood: <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the ſimilitudes that reſemble, or ſet forth this myſtery, many are given: but for our better underſtanding, let us conſider theſe few.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is of the ſoul and body, that make but one man: as the ſoul and body are two diſtinct things, and of ſeveral natures: yet being united by the hand of God, they make one Perſon: ſo the Godhead and Manhood are two diſtinct things, and of ſeveral Natures: yet being united by the hand of God, they make but one Perſon. Indeed herein is the ſimilitude defective: firſt in that the Soul and Body being imperfect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they concur to make one full and perfect nature of a man: Secondly, in that the one of them is not drawn into the unity of the ſubſtance of the other, but both depend on a third ſubſtance, which is that of the whole.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is of Light and Sun: as after the Collection of, and Union of the Light with the Body of the Sun, no man can pluck them aſunder: nor doth any man call one part the Sun, and another part the Light: but both of them jointly together, we call the Sun: even ſo after the Union of <hi>Fleſh</hi> with that true Light the <hi>Word,</hi> no man doth call the <hi>Word</hi> apart to be one Son of God, and the Son of Man another Son of God: but both of them jointly together, we call one and the ſelf-ſame Chriſt. I know in this ſimilitude are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my defectives:<note place="margin">Juſtin Martyr de recta confeſ. de Coeſſent. Trinit.</note> yet if hereby we be not altogether able to attain the truth of this great Myſtery, certainly <hi>we have herein a moſt excellent ſimilitude, which will greatly help, and contentedly ſuffice the godly and moderate ſearchers of this divine truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is of a fiery and flaming Sword: as the ſubſiſtences of the Fire and Sword are ſo nearly conjoyned, that the operations of them for the moſt part concur: for a fiery ſword in cutting, burneth, and in burning, cutteth: and we may ſay of the whole that this fiery thing is a ſharp piercing Sword, and that this ſharp piercing Sword is a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing: even ſo in the union of the two natures of Chriſt, there is a communication of properties from one of them to the other, as ſhall be declared, if the Lord permit: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this ſimilitude is defective in this, in that the nature of the Iron is not drawn into the unity of the ſubſiſtence of fire, nor is the nature of the fire drawn into the Unity of the ſubſiſtence of Iron: ſo that we cannot ſay, this fire is Iron, or this Iron is fire.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is of one man having two qualities, or accidental natures: as a man that is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94897:72"/> both a Phyſitian and a Divine; he is but one perſon, and yet there are two natures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring and meeting in that ſame one Perſon; ſo we may rightly ſay of ſuch a one, this Phyſitian is a Divine, and this Divine is a Phyſitian; this Phyſitian is happy in ſaving ſouls, and this Divine is careful in curing bodies: even ſo is Chriſt both God and Man, and yet but one Chriſt; and in that one Chriſt, according to the ſeveral natures, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations of either part; as that this man is God, and this God is man; or that this man made the world: and this God died upon the Croſs: but in this ſimilitude is this deffect, in that the different natures are accidental, and not eſſential or ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
                  <p>The fifth and laſt, is of the Branch and Tree into which it is engraffed; as ſuppoſe a Vine-branch and an Olive-tree: now as this Olive-tree is but one, but hath two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures in it, and ſo it beareth two kinds of fruit: and yet between the Tree and the Branch there is a compoſition, not <hi>hujus ex his,</hi> but <hi>hujus ad hoc (i.e.)</hi> not of a third thing out of the two things united, but of one of the two things united or adjoyned to the other: even ſo Chriſt is one, but he hath two different natures, and in them he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the different actions pertaining to either of them: and yet between the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures (the Divine and Humane nature) there is a compoſition, not <hi>hujus ex his</hi> but <hi>hujus ad hoc,</hi> not of a third nature ariſing out of theſe but of the humane nature added or united to the Divine, in unity of the ſame perſon: ſo that now we may ſay, as this Vine is an Olive-tree, and this Olive-tree is a Vine: or as this Vine bears O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives, and this Olive-tree bears Grapes, ſo the Son of man is the Son of God, and the Son of God is the Son of Man: or this Son of Man laid the Foundation of the Earth, and this Son of God was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> and crucified by the <hi>Jews.</hi> This ſimilitude (I take it) is the apteſt and fulleſt of all the other, though in ſome things alſo it doth fail; for the branch hath firſt a ſeparate ſubſiſtence in it ſelf, and loſing it after, then it is drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the unity of the ſubſiſtence of that Tree into which it is implanted; but it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the humane nature of Chriſt; it never had any ſubſiſtence of its own, until it was united to the perſon or ſubſiſtence of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the perſon aſſuming, and the nature aſſumed, and for the reaſon of this way; we ſay, 1. That the perſon aſſuming was a Divine perſon; it was not the Divine nature that aſſumed an humane perſon, but the Divine perſon that aſſumed an humane nature; and that of the three Divine perſons, it was neither firſt, nor the third; neither the Father nor the Holy Ghoſt that did aſſume this nature; but it was the Son, the middle perſon, who was to be the middle one, that thereby, 1. He might undertake the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation between God and us. 2. He might better preſerve the integrity of the bleſſed Trinity in the Godhead. 3. He might higher advance man-kind by means of that relation which the ſecond perſon, the Mediator did bear unto his Father: for this very end, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God ſent his own Son made of a woman,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The nature aſſumed was the ſeed of <hi>Abraham: for verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of</hi> Abraham:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.3. Gen. 3.15. Gal. 4.4.</note> elſewhere the Apoſtle calls it the ſeed of <hi>David: He is made the ſeed of</hi> David <hi>according to the Fleſh:</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he is called the ſeed of the Woman: <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed:</hi> and <hi>when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his ſon made of a woman:</hi> no queſtion ſhe was the paſſive and material principle of which that precious fleſh was made, and the Holy Ghoſt the agent and efficient: that bleſſed womb of her was the Bride-Chamber, wherein the holy Ghoſt did knit that indiſſoluble knot betwixt our humane Nature and his Deity: the Son of God aſſuming into the unity of his perſon that which before he was not, even our humane Nature. O with what aſtoniſhment may we behold our duſt and aſhes aſſumed into the unity of Gods own Perſon!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the reaſon of this way: why did the perſon aſſume a Nature? or rather, why did not the perſon of the Son of God joyn it ſelf to a perfect perſon of the Son of man? I anſwer.</p>

Becauſe then the work of each of the Natures of Chriſt could not have been count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the works of the whole perſon; whereas now by this union of both natures in one perſon, the obedience of Chriſt performed in the Manhood, is become of infinite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as being the Obedience of God; and thereupon God is ſaid <hi>to have purchaſed the Church with his own Blood.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Acts. 20.28.</note>3. Becauſe if the Perſon of the Son of God had been joyned to the Perſon of man, there ſhould have been four Perſons in the Trinity. It is very obſervable, how for the better preſervation of the integrity of the bleſſed Trinity in the Godhead, the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was aſſumed into the unity of the ſecond perſon; for if the fulneſs of the Godhead ſhould have dwelt in any humane Perſon; there ſhould then have been a fourth Perſon neceſſarily added unto the Godhead; and if any of the three Perſons beſides the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, had been born of a Woman, there ſhould then have been two Sons in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereas now the Son of God, and the Son of Man, being but one Perſon, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently but one Son; and ſo no alteration at all made in the relations of the Perſons of the Trinity, but they are ſtill one Father, one Son, and one Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the deep things of <hi>God,</hi> and indeed ſo exceedingly myſtical, that they can never be perfectly declared by any man. <hi>Bernard</hi> compares this ineffable myſtery of the union of two natures, with that incomprehenſible myſtery of the Trinity in <hi>unity.</hi> In the Trinity is three Perſons and one Nature; in Chriſt is two Natures and one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; that of the Trinity is indeed the greateſt, and this of the Incarnation, is like unto it; they both far exceed mans capacity; <hi>for his way is in the Sea, and his path in the great waters,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the effects and Benefits of this Hypoſtatical Union; they are either in reſpect of Chriſt, or in reſpect of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe in reſpect of Chriſt, are, 1. An exemption of all ſin. 2. A Collation of all Graces. 3. A Communication of all the properties,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We find that although Chriſt appeared as a ſinner, and that he was <hi>numbred among the wicked</hi> or <hi>with the Tranſgreſſors.</hi> Iſa. 53.12.<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.12.</note> Yet in very Deed and Truth <hi>he did no ſin, neither was any guile found in his mouth,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.22. Heb. 7.36.</note> The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>he was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from Sinners:</hi> he aſſumed the nature of man, yet by reaſon of his pure Conception, and of this Hypoſtatical Union he was conceived, and born, and lived without ſin; he took upon him the ſeed of man, but not the Sin of man, ſave only by imputation: but on this point I ſhall not ſtay.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Graces collated unto the humanity of Chriſt by reaſon of his union, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many: I ſhall inſtance in ſome: As, —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Manhood hath its ſubſiſtence in the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it ſelf (as of it ſelf) is deſtitute.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Manhood is a peculiar Temple for the Deity of Chriſt to dwell in: it is the place wherein the Godhead ſhews it ſelf more manifeſtly and more Gloriouſly than in any other Creature whatſoever: it is true, that by his providence he ſhews himſelf in all his Creatures, and by his Grace in his Saints: but he is only moſt Gloriouſly, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, according to the fulneſs of his Deity, and by an Hypoſtatical Union in the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily:</hi> Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that as now in this Life,<note place="margin">Col. 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>No man cometh unto God but by Chriſt;</hi> ſo hereafter in the next life, no man ſhall ſee God, but in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That in the Manhood is a nearer familiarity with the Godhead than any other Creature, whether Men or Angels: as ſometimes he ſaid, <hi>My Father and I are one: (i.e.)</hi> one eſſence; ſo he may as truly ſay, the Manhood and I are one <hi>(i.e.)</hi> one perſon for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Manhood of Chriſt, according to its meaſure, is a partner with the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> in the work of Redemption and Mediation: as he is <hi>Immanuel</hi> in reſpect of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo he is <hi>Immanuel</hi> in reſpect of his office. He muſt needs be man as well as God, that he might be able to ſend this comfortable meſſage to the Sons of men; <hi>go to my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 20 17.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſay to them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my</hi> God <hi>and your</hi> God. I, as man, am in the work of redemption, and in the work of mediation, as well as God: <hi>my Fleſh is indeed the Bread of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Manhood of Chriſt, together with the Godhead, is adored and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with Divine honour: as in like caſe, the honour done to the King, redounds to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94897:73"/> Crown upon his head; not that we worſhip the Manhood alone, as meerly a Creature; but that we adore the perſon of Chriſt which conſiſteth of the Manhood and of the Godhead.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Manhood hath an extraordinary meaſure, without meaſure, of habitual Graces, poured into it; in this he excels the very Angels, for to them was given Grace only by meaſure; but to the humanity of Chriſt was given Grace without meaſure; even ſo much as a Creature is any ways capable of. I know it is ſaid that <hi>Jeſus increaſed in Wiſdom, and Stature, and in favour with</hi> God <hi>and Man;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 2.52.</note> but this increaſe or growth in <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> is not to be underſtood in reſpect of the eſſence or extenſion of the habit (for that he had from the beginning, even from the firſt moment of his incarnation; and he brought it with him out of the womb) but in reſpect of the act and uſe of it, or in reſpect of his experimental knowledg, ſo he increaſed, and not otherwiſe. Never was there any but Chriſt, whoſe Graces were no way ſtinted, and that was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely full of Grace: Divines tell us of a double Grace in Chriſt; the one of union, and that is infinite; the other of unction (which is all one with Grace habitual) and that is in a ſort infinite; for howſoever it be but a finite and created thing, yet in the nature of Grace, it hath no limitation, no bounds, no ſtint, but includeth in it ſelf whatſoever any way pertains to Grace, or that cometh within the compaſs of it. The reaſon of this illimited donation of Grace beſtowed on the Nature of man in Chriſt, was, for that Grace was given to it as to the univerſal cauſe, whence it was to be derived unto all others; he is the Fountain of Grace,<note place="margin">John. 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>and of his fulneſs we receive</hi> Grace <hi>for</hi> Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Communication of the Properties. It is a kind, of phraſe of ſpeech pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Scriptures, when the properties of either Nature of Chriſt conſidered ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly and apart, are attributed to the perſon of Chriſt, from which ſoever of the natures they be denominated. For the underſtanding of this, obſerve, 1. That words are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſtractive or concretive; the former ſpeaks the Nature of things, the latter ſpeaks the perſon that hath that nature; as the God-Head and God; the Man Hood and Man; Holineſs and Holy. 2. Obſerve that abſtractive Words noting preciſely the diſtinct Natures, cannot be affirmed one of the other; we cannot ſay, the God head ſuffered, or the Man-hood created; but we may truly ſay, that God ſuffered, and man created; becauſe the perſon which theſe concretive words imply, is one: and all actions, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and qualities agree really to the perſon, though in reſpect ſomtimes of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſometimes of another: thus God <hi>purchaſed the Church with his own blood:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts. 20.28 John. 3.13.</note> not that the God-head ſhed blood, but the perſon which was God: and thus the <hi>Son of man</hi> talking with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> is ſaid to be in Heaven; not that the Man-hood was in Heaven while he was on earth, but the perſon of the Son of Man. Thus we may ſay that God was born of a Virgin, and that God ſuffered, and God was crucified; not ſimply in reſpect of his God-head, but in reſpect of his perſon; or in reſpect of the humane nature which God united to himſelf: becauſe God here is a concrete word, and not an abſtract, and ſignifieth the Perſon of Chriſt, and not the divine nature of Chriſt. And thus we may ſay, that the Man Chriſt is Almighty, Omniſcient, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, yet not ſimply in reſpect of its Man-hood, but in reſpect of the Perſon which is the ſame God and Man: or in reſpect of the divine nature of the man Chriſt Jeſus: for that here alſo Man is a concrete word, and not an abſtract, and ſignifieth the whole perſon of Chriſt, and not the humane nature: but on the contrary, we may not ſay, that the God-head of Chriſt was born of a Virgin, or ſuffered, or was crucified: nor may we ſay, that the Manhood of Chriſt is Almighty, Omniſcient, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent; becauſe the Godhead and Manhood are abſtract words <hi>(i.e.)</hi> ſuch words as note to us the two natures of Chriſt, the one divine, the other humane, and not the perſon of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And this I think is the mind of <hi>Luther</hi> and his Followers, and yet (O wonder) what a deal of objections are made to the multiplying of needleſs and fruitleſs contentions? The <hi>Lutherans</hi> confeſs (however they hold the ubiquitary preſence of the humanity of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) that his Body is only in one place locally: <hi>If we ask them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Effects or benefits of this hypoſtatical union in reſpect of Chriſtians, are their ſpiritual union and communion with God and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a ſpiritual union of Chriſtians with God in Chriſt; O the wonder of theſe two bleſſed unions; firſt of the perſonal or hypoſtatical union; ſecondly of this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or myſtical union; in the perſonal union, it pleaſed God to aſſume and unite our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature to the Diety; in this ſpiritual union, it pleaſed God to unite the perſon of every Believer to the perſon of the Son of God. This union is myſtical, and yet our very Perſons, natures, bodies, ſouls are in a ſpiritual way conjoyned to the Body and Soul of Chriſt;<note place="margin">Eph. 5.30.</note> ſo that <hi>we are members of the Body of Chriſt, and of the Fleſh of Chriſt, and of the Bones of Chriſt;</hi> and as this conjunction is immediately made with his humane nature;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> ſo thereby we are alſo united to <hi>the divine nature;</hi> yea, the perſon of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is indiſſolubly united to the Glorious perſon of the Son God.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning this union, for our better underſtanding, obſerve theſe four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a moſt real union; it is not a meer notional and intellectual union, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in the underſtanding and without the underſtanding is nothing; it is not an imaginary thing, that hath no other being but only in the Brain; no, no, it is a true, real, eſſential, ſubſtantial union; In natural unions, I confeſs, there may be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but there cannot be more <hi>truth;</hi> ſpiritual Agents neither have, nor put forth leſs virtue, becauſe ſenſe cannot diſcern their manner of Working; even the Load-ſtone, though an earthen ſubſtance, yet when it is out of ſight, whether under the <hi>table,</hi> or behind a ſolid partition, it ſtirreth the needle as effectually as if it were within view. Shall not he contradict his ſences, that will ſay, <hi>It cannot work, becauſe I ſee it not?</hi> Oh my Saviour! thou art more mine, than my Body is mine: my ſenſe feels that preſent, but ſo as that I muſt loſe it: but my faith ſo feels, and ſees thee preſent with me, as that I ſhall never be parted from thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a very near union: You will ſay, how near? If an Angel were to ſpeak to you, he cannot ſatisfie you in this: only as far as our underſtanding can reach it, and the Creatures can ſerve to illuſtrate theſe things, take it thus: Whatſoever by way of compariſon can be alledged concerning the combination of any one thing with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that, and much more may be ſaid of our union with Jeſus Chriſt. To give inſtance out of the Scripture: ſee what one ſtick is to another being <hi>glewed together:</hi> ſee what one friend is to another, as <hi>Jonathan and David,</hi> who were ſaid to be <hi>woven and knit</hi> each one to other: ſee how near the father and the child are: how near the husband and the wife are:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 17. 1 Sam. 18.1. Iſa. 62.5.</note> ſee what union is between the Branches and the Vine, the members and the head; nay, one thing more; ſee what the the ſoul is to the body: ſuch is Chriſt, and ſo near is Chriſt, and nearer to the perſon of every true believer: <hi>I live, yet not I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) but Chriſt liveth in me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 15.5. 1 Cor. 12 12. Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                     <hi>q. d.</hi> as the ſoul is to the body of a natural man, that acts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens it naturally, ſo is Jeſus Chriſt to my ſoul and body. O there is a marvellous near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this myſtical union.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a total union; <hi>(i.e.)</hi> whole Chriſt is united to the whole believer, ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. If thou art united to Chriſt, thou haſt all Chriſt: thou art one with him in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in his name: thou haſt the ſame Image, Grace, and Spirit in thee, as he hath; the ſame precious Promiſes, the ſame acceſs to God by prayer as he; thou haſt the ſame love of the Father; all that he did or ſuffered, thou haſt a ſhare in it: thou haſt his life and death: all is thine: ſo on thy part, he hath thee wholly, thy nature, thy ſins, the puniſhment of thy ſins, thy wrath, thy curſe, thy ſhame: yea, thy wit, and wealth, and ſtrength, all that thou art, or haſt, or canſt do poſſibly for him. It is a total union: <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his:</hi> whole Chriſt from top to toe is mine, and all that I am, have, or can do, for evermore is his.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is an inſeparable union, it can never be broken. <hi>I will make</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>an everlaſting Covenant with them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 32.40.</note> 
                     <hi>and I will not turn away from them to do them good, I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> This is a glorious promiſe: ſome poor ſouls may ſay. <hi>True Lord, thou wilt not turn away from me: I know thou wilt not: Oh, but I fear I ſhall turn away from thee: Oh alaſs, I turn every day towards ſin and Satan! Nay, ſaith</hi> God, I <hi>will put my fear in their heart, that thou ſhalt not turn away from me:</hi> q. d. We ſhall be kept together for evermore and never be ſeparated. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> triumphantly challenges all enemies on earth, (or rather in hell) to do their worſt to break this knot:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of</hi> God <hi>in Chriſt? ſhall tribulation,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94897:74"/> Diſtreſs, Famine, Nakedneſs, Peril or Sword?</hi> Come all that can come, and ſee if that bleſſed union betwixt me and Chriſt, ſhall ever be broken, by all that you can do. Thus for this union.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a ſpiritual communion with God in Chriſt. Both theſe are the effects of Chriſts perſonal or hypoſtatical union: firſt, union to his perſon, and then communion with his benefits: union in proper ſpeaking is not unto any of the benefits flowing to us from Chriſt: we are not united to forgiveneſs of Sin, Holineſs, Peace of Conſcience, but unto the perſon of the Son of God himſelf: and then ſecondly, comes this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of all the benefits ariſing immediately from this union to the Lord Jeſus: that as Chriſt was Prieſt, Prophet, and King: ſo we alſo by him, are after a ſort Prieſts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Kings: for being made one with him, we are thereby poſſeſſed of all things that are his, as the Wife is of the wealth of her Husband; <hi>now all things are yours,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the World,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
                  <p>Hitherto have we took a view of Chriſt in his Mothers Womb;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 21.23</note> and O what marvails there! Did ever womb carry ſuch a fruit? Well might the Angel ſay, <hi>Bleſſed art thou amongſt Women!</hi> and well might <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is the Fruit of thy Womb!</hi> but the bleſſing is not only in conceiving, but in bearing; and therefore we proceed.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. THe birth of Chriſt now follows. Now was it that the Son of Righteouſneſs ſhould break forth from his bed, where nine months he had hid himſelf, as behind a fruitful cloud: this was the worlds wonder; a thing ſo wonderful, that it was given for a ſign unto believers ſeven hundred and forty years before it was accompliſhed:<note place="margin">Iſa. 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign; behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son.</hi> A wonder indeed! and great, beyond all compariſon: that the Son of God ſhould be born of a Woman: that he who is the true <hi>Melchizedech, without Father, and without Mother,</hi> muſt yet have a mother-Virgin: that he that is before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, ſhould yet be born after <hi>Abraham</hi> a matter of two thouſand years: that he who was <hi>Davids</hi> Son, &amp; therefore born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſhould yet be <hi>Davids</hi> Lord; <hi>wonderful things are ſpoken of thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.3.</note> 
                     <hi>O thou Son of God:</hi> before he was born, the Prophets ſing, the <hi>Sybils</hi> propheſie, the Patriarchs typiſie, the Types foretel, God promiſeth, and the Son of God performeth; when he was born, Angels run errands, <hi>Gabriel</hi> brings tidings, the glory of Heaven ſhines, a Star diſplaies, and wiſe men are the Heralds, that proclaim his Birth. But come yet a little nearer, <hi>Let us go to Bethlehem</hi> (as the Shepherds ſaid) <hi>and ſee this thing which is come to paſs!</hi> if we ſtep but one ſtep into his loding, Heavens wonder is before our eyes; now <hi>Look upon Jeſus!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 2.15.</note> look on him as in fulneſs of time he carried on the great work of our Salvation: here now you may read the meaning of <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant, <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> revelation, <hi>Davids</hi> ſucceſſion; theſe were but vailes; but now ſhall we draw aſide the Curtains? come, take a view of the truth it ſelf; O wonder of wonders! whom find we in this lodging? a Babe in a Cratch, a Mother-maid, a Father-virgin: is this the Babe whom we <hi>look unto</hi> as our Jeſus? is this a Mother (as <hi>Auſtin</hi>) ſcarce fourteen years of age? is this the Father that <hi>knew her not, until ſhe had brought forth her firſt-born Son?</hi>

Look on the Babe, there is no Cradle to rock him, no Nurſe to Lull him, no Linnens to ſwaddle him, ſcarce a little food to nouriſh him; look on the Mother, there's no Mid-wives help, no downy pillows, no linnen hangings, ſcarce a little ſtraw where ſhe is brought a-bed: look on <hi>Joſeph</hi> the reputed Father: he rather begs, than gives a bleſſing: poor Carpenter! that makes them a Chamber of an Oxe-ſtall, and carves him a Cratch to be his Cradle: <hi>Mary</hi> that ſees with her eyes, and ponders all in her heart, how doth modeſt ſhame fac'dneſs change her colours ſo often as her imagination works? <hi>ſhe muſt bear a Son:</hi> an Angel tells her, the Holy Ghoſt overſhadows her, the dayes are accompliſhed, and ſhe is delivered; each Circumſtance is enough to abaſh a modeſt Virgin: But who will not wonder? a Maid believes, a Maid conceives, a Maid brings forth, and a Maid ſtill remains: How might we deſcant on this Subject? but I ſhall contract my ſelf, and reduce all wonders to this word, <hi>I am the Vine.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is a bleſſed Parable: in which, under the ſhadow of a Vine, Chriſt elegantly ſets forth himſelf. Chriſt in many reſemblances is a precious Vine; but why a Vine, rather than a Cedar, Oak, or ſome of the ſtrongeſt, talleſt trees? Many reaſons are given: as,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94897:75"/> 1. Becauſe of all Trees the Vine is the loweſt: it grovels, as it were, on the ground. 2. Becauſe of all Trees the Vine is weakeſt; hence they that have Vines, have alſo their Elms to ſupport them, and hold them up. 3. Becauſe of all Trees, the Vine hath the meaneſt Bark and outſide: it is of little worth or reputation. 4.

For the Plant: the way of Vines is not to be ſowed, but planted; that thus tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they might better fructifie: ſo our Jeſus, firſt ſprung from his Father, is planted in a Virgins womb; God from God, coeternal with God; but by his Incarnation made that he was not, and yet remaining that he was; God of his Father, and Man of his Mother; before all time, yet ſince the beginning. <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us, <hi>that this Vine ſprung of the Vine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ber.</hi> de Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Dom.</note> 
                     <hi>is God begotten of God, the Son of the Father, both coeternal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial with the Father; but that he might better fructifie, he was planted in the Earth;</hi> (i.e.) <hi>he was conceived in a Virgins womb.</hi> There is indeed a reſemblance in this; in this reſemblance, we muſt be careful to obſerve that communication of properties; of which I told you, we may truly ſay, that God was planted, or conceived, but not the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; God is a concrete word, and ſignifies the Perſon of Chriſt: and his Perſon was planted or conceived, not ſimply as God: but in reſpect of the Manhood united to it: and thus he that is infinite, was conceived; and he that is eternal, even he was born: the very fulneſs of all perfection, and all the properties of the Divine Eſſence are by this <hi>communication</hi> given to the nature of man in the Perſon of the Son of God: no wonder therefore, that we ſay, that this Vine (the Son of God) is planted in <hi>Mary;</hi> I know ſome would have the Plant more early: and therefore they ſay, that Chriſt was <hi>a Vine planted in</hi> Adam, <hi>budded in</hi> David, <hi>and flouriſhed in</hi> Mary: but I take this but for a flouriſh: all before <hi>Mary</hi> were but Types, now was the Truth: now in <hi>Mary</hi> was Chriſt planted, and not before: as in the beginning, <hi>there was not a Man to Till the Ground:— but out of the ground the Lord made to grow every Tree:—and a River went out of Eden to water the Garden:</hi> ſo there was no man that tilled this Ground: but out of this Ground (the Virgin) the Lord made to grow this Plant, watering it by his Spirit: <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1.35.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee:</hi> Of this conception, and of the Holy Ghoſts efficiency, I believe, ſpake the Prophet, when there was ſuch longing after Chriſt's coming in the fleſh:<note place="margin">Iſa. 45.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Drop down ye Heavens from above, and let the Sky pour down Righteouſneſs, let the Earth open, and bring forth Salvation.</hi> But of this Conception before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the Bud: the nature of Vines is to Bud, before it Bloſſom or bring forth its fruit:<note place="margin">Pſal. 85.11.</note> ſo was it ſaid of Chriſt before he came, <hi>Truth ſhall Bud out of the Earth;</hi> now what was this budding of Truth out of the Earth, but Chriſt born of a Woman? <hi>What was the Truth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine) but Chriſt?</hi>

                     <hi>and what the Earth, but our fleſh? and what Truth budding, but Chriſt being born?</hi> Here let us ſtay a while: ſurely it is worth the while (as the Spouſe ſaid in another place) to <hi>get up early to the Vineyards, and to ſee how the Vine did flouriſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 7.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and how the tender Grape did open.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Chriſts carrying on the great Work of our Salvation before all Worlds, we told you of Gods <hi>Councils,</hi> as if he had been reduced to ſome ſtraits and difficulties by the croſs demands of his ſeveral Attributes: but <hi>Wiſdom</hi> found out a way, how to reconcile theſe differences by propounding a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and in him <hi>Mercy and Truth met together, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Peace kiſſed each other.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 85.10.</note> That reconciliation was in the Counſel of God from all Eternity: but for the execution of this Counſel, it was now in the fulneſs of time, even at this time when Chriſt was born: Now in deed and in truth, in execution and performance, was the reconciliation of all differences: and of this time was the Pſalmiſts Prophecy more eſpecially meant: <hi>Mercy and Truth ſhall meet together, Righteouſneſs and Peace ſhall kiſs each other:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 85.10, 12</note> 
                     <hi>and Truth ſhall bud out of the Earth, and Righteouſneſs ſhall look down from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe words we find, firſt a meeting of Gods bleſſed Attributes; and ſecondly, this
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94897:75"/> meeting at a birth, the birth of Truth: at which meeting thirdly was that glorious effect, <hi>that Righteouſneſs looked down,</hi> and indeed came down <hi>from Heaven;</hi> I deſire a little to invert the words, and ſhall firſt ſpeak to Chriſts Birth; ſecondly, to the effects of his Birth, of <hi>Righteouſneſs looking down from Heaven;</hi> thirdly, to the meeting and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of all Gods Attributes as the iſſue and effect of all; <hi>When Mercy and Truth met together, and Righteouſneſs and Peace kiſſed each other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For his Birth; our Vine doth Bud, <hi>Truth ſhall Bud out of the Earth, (i.)</hi> Chriſt ſhall be born upon the Earth, or Chriſt ſhall be born of a Woman; for <hi>Truth</hi> is Chriſt, Bud is <hi>born,</hi> and <hi>the Earth]</hi> is a Woman. 1. <hi>Truth]</hi> is Chriſt: <hi>I am the Way and Truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.4, 6,</note> ſaid Chriſt; he is the truth of all Types, and the truth of all Propheſies, and the truth of all promiſes; <hi>for in him are all the Promiſes, Yea and Amen.</hi> 2. <hi>Bud]</hi> is born: the Vine budding is the firſt putting forth of the Grape; ſo Chriſt being born, was Truth budding out of the Earth, he then firſt ſhewed himſelf to the World, and was firſt ſeen (like the Vine ſpringing forth) above ground. 3. The <hi>Earth]</hi> is the Woman;<note place="margin">Iſa. 45.8.</note> thus ſome render that Text, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth a Saviour:</hi> look how the Field-flowers ſpring forth of themſelves without any Seed caſt in by the hand of Man; ſo the Virgin brings forth Chriſt. It is obſervable that in the Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> was laid the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of this future birth: begin with the firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> and you may ſee him paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd in this ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt. <hi>Adam</hi> was created of the Virgin-Earth, Chriſt was born of a Virgin-Mother; the Earth had no Husbandman, yet brought forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Seed: <hi>Mary</hi> had no Husband, yet brought forth without Seed of Man: in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man:</hi> and now ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>the Word is made fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26. John 1.14.</note> or the Word is Man indeed: thoſe were but Types, but Chriſt is the Truth: he is the Vine that Buds, the Meſſias born; the Angels own him, the Star deſignes him, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets foreſhew him, the Devils confeſs him, his Miracles declare him, the Sages ſeek him, and Heaven and Earth Rings with the News, that <hi>Truth is Budded out of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the effect of this Birth, <hi>Righteouſneſs ſhall look down from Heaven.</hi> No ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Chriſt born, but Righteouſneſs looked down from Heaven; ſhe caſt her eye upon Earth, and ſeeing Truth freſhly ſprung there, ſhe looked and looked again; certainly it was a ſight to draw all the eyes of Heaven to it. It is ſaid of the Angels that <hi>they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to look into theſe things:</hi> they looked wiſhly at them,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note> as if they would look through them: no queſtion but <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> looked as narrowly and piercingly as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Some obſerve that the Hebrew word, <hi>ſhe looked down,</hi> ſignifies that <hi>ſhe beat out a window;</hi> ſo deſirous was <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to behold the ſight of <hi>the Vine Budding,</hi> of Chriſt being born, that ſhe beats out a Window in Heaven: before this time, ſhe would not ſo much as <hi>look down</hi> towards the Earth: <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> had no proſpect, no window open this way: ſhe turned away her eyes, and clapt to the Caſement, and would not abide ſo much as to look on ſuch ſinful wretches, forlorn ſinners as we are; her eye was purer than to behold Iniquity, ſhe abhorred it, and us for it: and therefore would not vouchſafe us once to caſt off her eye. O but now the caſe is altered: no ſooner doth our <hi>Vine Bud upon the Earth,</hi> but ſhe is willing to condeſcend, and ſo willing, that ſhe breaks a Window through the Walls of Heaven to look down upon this Bud: and nomar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: for, what could <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> deſire to ſee, and ſatifie her ſelf in, that was not to be ſeen in Jeſus Chriſt? He was all righteous, there was not the leaſt ſpot of ſin to be found in him: his Birth was clean, and his Life was holy, and his Death was innocent; both his Soul and Body were without all ſin; both his Spirit and his Mouth were without all guile; whatſoever ſatisfaction <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> would have, ſhe might have it in him, <hi>lay Judgment to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Balance,</hi> and there is nothing in <hi>Jeſus</hi> but Streight for the Line, and full Weight for the Balance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the meeting and agreement of all Gods Attributes, as the iſſue and the leaſt effect of this budding Vine, the Verſe before tells us; that <hi>Mercy and Truth are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other:</hi> This meeting preſuppoſeth a diſtance before they met: for they that meet come from divers coaſts. Here then are two things conſiderable; firſt the diſtance, and ſecondly, the meeting. But you will ſay, how came this diſtance? Are they not all the Attributes of Gods undivided eſſence? are they not all four in the boſom of God from all eternity? I anſwer, Yes: they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided in themſelves, but they were divided about us; it was <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and ours in him, that firſt divided Heaven, yea the very Attributes of God, and in a ſort, God himſelf: I ſhall ſpeak to both theſe, that you may firſt ſee the Differences, and
<pb facs="tcp:94897:76"/> then the Agreement and bleſſed <hi>Harmony</hi> of theſe glorious Attributes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Difference; immediately after the Fall, the great queſtion (which before you heard of in the Decree and Councils of God) was actually propounded, <hi>What ſhould be done with ſinful Man?</hi> in this caſe we muſt ſpeak of God after the manner of men; and I hope you will give me the liberty that others (I ſuppoſe warrantably) take: <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>What ſhall be done with ſinful Man?</hi> He hath violated my Law, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my Command, and as much as lies in him, unpinn'd the Fabrick of the World, ſpoiled my Glorious Work of Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, and all therein: undone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ever and ever, and ever. <hi>O what ſhall be done with this ſinful, rebellious, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn unhappy Creature, Man?</hi> Silence being a while in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and all ſtruck into amaze, to ſee the great God of <hi>Heaven</hi> ſtirred up in wrath, at laſt <hi>Mercy and Peace</hi> ſtand up, and they ſeek with ſweet, gentle intreaties to pacifie Gods Anger: but <hi>Righteouſneſs and Truth</hi> are on the contrary ſide: and they provoke God Almighty to go on, and to manifeſt himſelf (as he is indeed) <hi>a conſuming Fire,</hi> a ſin-revenging God. The Plea is drawn up, and reported at large by <hi>Bernard, Andrews,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Mercy began; for out of her readineſs to do good, ſhe is ever formoſt: her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is to pitty, or rather ſhe her ſelf is an inclination to pity thoſe that are in miſery: and if ſhe can but relieve them, let them deſerve what they will, be ſure ſhe will relieve them: for ſhe looks not to the party what he is, nor what he hath done, nor what he he deſerved: but (which is the comfort of us miſerable ſinners) ſhe looks at what he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and in how woful and wretched a caſe he is. Her Plea was thus; <hi>What Lord haſt thou made all Men in vain? wilt thou now deſtroy him for whom thou madeſt the World? ſhall the houſholder be caſt out, and thrown into priſon, and there remain till he hath paid the utmoſt Farthing? ſhall all the Men and Women in the World, from firſt to laſt, be damned for ever and ever? alas! What profit is in their Blood? What will it avail to crowd Men and Devils together in Hell-flames? Will not thoſe Devils, the grand Enemies of</hi> God, <hi>rejoyce at this? And what then will become of thy great Name on Earth? Is not this thy Name? The Lord, the Lord, Merciful, and Gracious, Long-ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſions and Sins? What will the Lord undo his Name? Will the Lord caſt off for ever? And will he be favourable no more? Is his Mercy clean gone for ever? Will he be no more entreated? hath God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be gracious? Hath he in Anger ſhut up his tender Bowels?</hi> With theſe, and ſuch like holy whiſperings or mutterings did <hi>Mercy</hi> enter into Gods bowels, and make them yern, and melt again into compaſſions.</p>
                  <p>But 2. <hi>Truth</hi> muſt be heard as well as <hi>Mercy;</hi> and ſhe layes in matter of exception, and her Plea was thus; <hi>What is</hi> God <hi>but his Word? Now this was thy word to</hi> Adam, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death; and this was thy word to all the Sons of</hi> Adam,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Theſe were the Controverſies at that time: ſo that <hi>Peace</hi> could not tell how to ſpeak a prevailing word amongſt them: nay the controverſie grew ſo high, that they made it their own caſes: <hi>what ſhall become of me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Mercy) if</hi> God <hi>ſpare not ſinners?</hi> and <hi>what ſhall become of me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Juſtice) if</hi> God <hi>do ſpare ſinners? what ſhall become of me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Mercy) If</hi> God <hi>will ſhew no mercy?</hi> And <hi>what ſhall become of me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Juſtice) if</hi> God <hi>will do no Juſtice? why, alas periſh</hi> (ſaid <hi>Mercy) if thou wilt not pity: if man die, I die alſo:</hi> and <hi>I periſh</hi> (ſaid <hi>Juſtice) if thou wilt have mercy: ſurely I die, if man die not.</hi> To this it came, and in theſe terms brake up the Aſſembly, and away they went one from another. <hi>Truth</hi> went to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and was a Stranger upon Earth, <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> went with her, and would not ſo much as look down from <hi>Heaven: Mercy,</hi> ſhe ſtaid
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94897:76"/> below ſtill; for where ſhould <hi>Mercy</hi> be, if not with the miſerable? As for <hi>Peace,</hi> ſhe went between both, to ſee if ſhe could make them meet again in better terms: in the mean while, our Salvation lies a bleeding; the Plea hangs, and we ſtand as Priſoners at the Bar, and know not what ſhall become of us; for though two be for us, yet two are againſt us, as ſtrong, and more ſtiff than they: ſo that much depends upon this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for either they muſt be at peace between themſelves, or they cannot be at peace with us, nor can we be at peace with God.</p>
                  <p>Many means were made before Chriſts time for a bleſſed meeting, but it would not be; <hi>Sacrifice and Burnt-Offering thou wouldſt not have:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 10.5.</note> theſe means were not prevalent enough to cauſe a meeting. Where ſtuck it? you will ſay: Surely it was not long of <hi>Mercy,</hi> ſhe was eaſie to be intreated: ſhe looked up to Heaven, but Righteouſneſs would not look down; and indeed here was the buſineſs: <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> muſt and will have ſatisfaction, or elſe <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſhould not be Righteous; either ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſin muſt be given to God, or ſhe will never meet more; better all men in the World were damned, than that the Righteouſneſs of God ſhould be Unrighteous. And this now puts on the great tranſaction of our Saviours Birth.</p>
                  <p>Well then, our Saviour is born; and this birth occaſions a gracious meeting of the Attributes: ſuch an attractive is this Birth, this <hi>Bud of Chriſt,</hi> that all meet there; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they cannot otherwiſe but meet in him in whom all bleſſed Attributes of God do meet.

O the bleſſed effects of this Birth of Chriſt! it is Chriſt that reconciled them, and that reconciled us and them; <hi>He reconciled all things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>whether they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1.20.</note> Now is Heaven at peace with it ſelf, and Heaven and Earth at peace one with another; and that which glues all, and makes the Peace, is this Birth of Chriſt; the budding of this Vine. <hi>Truth ſhall Bud out of the Earth, and then Mercy and Truth ſhall meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>SOme Conſequents after the Birth of Chriſt may be touched, whileſt yet he was but a Child of twelve years old. As,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When he was but eight dayes old, he was Circumciſed, and named <hi>Jeſus.</hi> As there was ſhame in his Birth, ſo there was pain in his Circumciſion; a ſharp Razor paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through his skin preſently after he is born; not that he needed this Ceremony, but that for us he was content to be legally impure. In this early humiliation he plainly diſcovers the Riches of his Grace; now he ſheds his Blood in drops, and thereby gives an earneſt of thoſe Rivers which he afterwards poured out for the cleanſing of our Nature, and extinguiſhing the wrath of God; and for a further diſcovery of his Grace, at this time his Name is given him, which was <hi>Jeſus.</hi> This is the name which we ſhould engrave in our hearts; reſt our Faith on, and place our help in, and love with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of Charity, and Joy, and Adoration; above all things we had need of a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a Saviour for our Souls, and from our ſins, and from the everlaſting deſtruction which ſin will otherwiſe bring upon our Souls; hence this Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> and this Sign <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> are joined together; for by the effuſion of his blood he was to be our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our Saviour: <hi>Without ſhedding of Blood is no remiſſion of Sins,</hi> no Salvation of Souls.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22. Rom. 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was the Seal,</hi> and now was it that our Jeſus was under God's Great Seal to take his Office: We have heard how he carried on the great Work of our Salvation from Eternity; this very Name and Office of Jeſus, <hi>a Saviour,</hi> was reſolved on in Gods fore-councel, and given forth from the beginning; and we have heard of late how it was promiſed and foretold by an Angel;<note place="margin">John. 6.27.</note> but now it is Signed and Sealed with an abſolute Commiſſion and fulneſs of Power; <hi>Him hath God the Father fealed,</hi> John. 6.27. It is his Office and his very profeſſion to ſave, that all may repair unto him to that end:<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28. John 6.37. John 4.42.</note> 
                     <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary;</hi> and <hi>him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> in which reſpect he is called <hi>the Saviour of the world (i.e.)</hi> of Samaritans, Jewes, Gentiles, Kings, Shepherds, and of all ſorts of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When he was forty daies old, <hi>he was brought to Jeruſalem, and preſented to the Lord; as it is written in the Law of the Lord, every Male that openeth the womb ſhall be called Holy to the Lord.</hi> O wonder! there was no impurity in the Son of God, and yet he is firſt circumciſed, and then he is brought and offered to the Lord;<note place="margin">Luke 2.22, 23</note> he that came to be ſin for us, would in our Perſons be legally unclean, that by ſatisfying the Law, he might take away our uncleanneſs; he that was above the Law, would come under the Law, that he might free us from the Law; we are all born ſinners; but O the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercy of our Jeſus, that provides a remedy as early as our ſin: firſt, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and then he is born, to ſanctifie our Conceptions and our Births; and after his Birth, he is firſt Circumciſed, and then he is preſented to the Lord; that by two holy acts, that which was naturally unholy might be hallowed unto God: Chriſt hath not left our very Infancy without redreſs, but by himſelf, thus offered, he cleanſeth us preſently from our filthineſs.—Now is Chriſt brought in his Mothers Arms to his own Houſe, the Temple; and as Man, he is preſented to himſelf, as God. O how Glorious did that Temple ſeem, now the Owner was within the walls of it! Now was the Hour, and Gueſt come, in regard whereof the ſecond Temple ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the firſt; this was the Houſe built for him, and dedicated to him; there had he dwelt long in his Typical preſence, nothing was done there whereby he was not reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and now the body of theſe ſhadows is come, and preſents himſelf, where he had ever been repreſented. You will ſay, what is this to me, or to my Soul? O yes! <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> is now every where; there is no Church-Aſſembly, no Chriſtian heart which is not a Temple of the Living God; and there is no Temple of God wherein Chriſt is not preſented to his Father: Thus we have the benefit of Chriſt's fulfilling the Law of Righteouſneſs; <hi>God ſent his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3.4, 5.</note> It is, as if the Father ſhould have ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Come my dear Son, here are certain Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors under the Law, to ſuffer and to be executed; what ſay you to them? Why, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come under the Law</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will take upon me their Execution, and ſuffer for them;</hi> and to this purpoſe he is firſt circumciſed; and then he is preſented to the Lord.</p>

                     <hi>and return again into the land of Iſrael, for they are dead which ſought the young Childs Life.

O the wonderful diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Chriſt in concealing of himſelf from men! all this while he carries himſelf as an Infant, and though he know all things, yet he neither takes, nor gives any notice of his removal or diſpoſing, but appoints that to be done by his Angel, which the Angel could not have done but by him. As Chriſt was pleaſed to take upon him our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo in our Nature he was pleaſed to be a perfect Child; for that is the word; <hi>take the young Child and his Mother;</hi> he ſuppreſt the manifeſtation and exerciſe of that Godhead, whereto the Infant-nature was conjoyned, as the Birth of Chriſt, ſo the infancy of Chriſt was exceeding humble: Oh how ſhould we magnifie him, or deject our ſelves for him, who himſelf became thus humble for our ſakes?</p>

He, who as God, gave them all the Wiſdom they had, doth now, as the Son of man, hearken to the Wiſdom he had given them; and when he had heard, then he asks; and after that, no doubt he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; his very queſtions were inſtructions; for I cannot think that he meant ſo much to learn, as to teach thoſe Doctors of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Surely theſe Rabbins had never heard the voice of ſuch a Tutor; they could not but ſee the very Wiſdom of God in this Child;<note place="margin">V. 47.</note> and therefore, ſaith the Text, <hi>they all wonder;</hi> or they were all aſtoniſhed <hi>at his underſtanding and anſwers;</hi> their eyes ſaw nothing but a Child, but their ears heard the wonderfull things of Gods Law; betwixt what they ſaw, and what they heard, they could not but be diſtracted and amazed. But why did ye not (O ye Jewiſh teachers) remember now the Star and the Sages, and the Angels, and the Shepherds; why did ye not now bethink your ſelves of <hi>Herod,</hi> and of his enquiry, and of your anſwer, that in <hi>Bethlehem of Judea Chriſt ſhould be born?</hi> You cited the prophets, and why did you not mind that Propheſie now,<note place="margin">Iſa. 56.</note> that, <hi>unto us a Child is born, and unto us a Son is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and his Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Councellor, the Mighty</hi> God, <hi>the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father, the Prince of peace?</hi> Fruitleſs is the wonder that endeth not in Faith; no Light is ſufficient, where the eyes were held through unbelief and prejudice.</p>

O the Poverty, Humility, Severity of <hi>Jeſus!</hi> it appears at this time eſpecially, in his Labouring, Working, Hewing of Wood, or the like; here's a ſharp reproof to all thoſe that ſpend their time in idleneſs, or without a particular Calling, that take no pains at all, unleſs in purſuit after Vain, Fooliſh, Superfluous, Sinful things; what! are they wiſer than Chriſt? Our Jeſus would not by any means thus ſpend his time. Indeed for the while he did nothing famous, or of publick note;<note place="margin">Nihil faciendo fecit magnificn.</note> but neither was this without a Myſtery: <hi>In doing nothing Publick,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>He atchieved great, and ſumptuous, and praiſe-worthy acts:</hi> There is a ſeaſon and time to every purpoſe under heaven: as <hi>there is a time of ſilence, and a time to ſpeak,</hi> ſo there is a time for publick, and a time for private Negotiations; as yet Chriſt conceals his virtues, and conforms himſelf to the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, that the Myſtery of his Incarnation might not be thought a Phantaſme; then he would have his Virtues and Graces to ſhine out, when men uſually come to their vigour and ſtrength both of body and mind.

                     <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Of knowing Jeſus as carrying on the great Work of our Salvation in his Birth.</head>
                  <p>WHat <hi>Looking]</hi> comprehends, you have heard before: And that we may have an inward experimental <hi>look on him</hi> whom our ſouls pant after, let us pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all theſe Particulars: As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us <hi>know Jeſus,</hi> carrying on the great work of our Salvation in his Coming or Incarnation. Come let us learn what he did for us when he came amongſt us. There is not one Paſſage in his firſt appearing, but it is of mighty concernment unto us: Is it poſſible that the great God of Heaven and Earth ſhould ſo infinitely condeſcend (as we have heard) but on ſome great Deſign? And what Deſign could there be, but only his Glory, and the Creatures good? O my Soul! If thou haſt any intereſt in Chriſt, all this concerns thee; the Lord Jeſus in theſe very tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions had an eye to thee; he was Incarnate for thee, he was conceived, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94897:79"/> born for thee; look not on theſe things as Notionals, or Generals; look not on the bare hiſtory of things; for that is but unprofitable; the main duty is in eying the end, the meaning, and intent of Chriſt; and eſpecially as it relates to thee, not to others, but to thy ſelf. Alas! what comfort were it to a poor priſoner, if he ſhould hear that the King or Prince, of his meer grace and love, viſited all the Priſoners in this and that Dungeon, and that he made a Goal-delivery, and ſet all free, but he never came near the Place where he poor wretch lies bound in Fetters and cold Irons? or ſuppoſe he gives a viſit to that very man, and offers him the tenders of Grace and Freedom, if he will but accept of it; and (becauſe of his waywardneſs) Perſwades, Intreats, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to come out, and take his liberty; and yet he will not regard, or apply it to himſelf, what comfort can he have? what fruit, what benefit ſhall he receive? Dear ſoul, this is thy caſe, if thou art not in Chriſt, if thou hadſt not heard the Offer, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and cloſed with it, then what is Chriſt's Incarnation, Conception, Nativity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee? Come! learn! not meerly as a Scholar, to gain ſome notional-knowledge; but as a Chriſtian, as one that feels virtue coming out of Chriſt in every of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: Study cloſe this great tranſaction in reference to thy ſelf. I know not how it happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If rightly applied, it is a Chriſtians joy; <hi>Behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy that ſhall be to all People; for unto you is born in the City of David,</hi>

                     <hi>a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Sure the Birth of Chriſt is of mighty concernment unto thee;<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.</note> 
                     <hi>unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given;</hi> there is not any piece of this tranſaction, but it is of ſpecial uſe and worth thy pains. How many break their brains, and waſte their Spirits in ſtudying Arts and Sciences, things in compariſon of no value; whereas <hi>Paul</hi> otherwiſe <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to know any thing among you but Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> To know Jeſus Chriſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry piece and point,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> whether in Birth, or Life, or Death, it is ſaving knowledge. O ſtand not upon Coſt, whether Pains or Study, Tears or Prayers, Peace or Wealth, Goods or Name, Life or Liberty; ſell all for this Pearl. Chriſt is of that worth and uſe, that thou canſt never over-buy him, though thou gaveſt thy ſelf and all the World for him; the ſtudy of Chriſt is the ſtudy of ſtudies; the knowledge of Chriſt is the knowledge of every thing that is neceſſary, either for this World, or for the World to come. O ſtudy Chriſt in every of the foreſaid reſpects.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Conſidering Jeſus in that reſpect.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. LEt us <hi>conſider Jeſus,</hi> carrying on this great work of our Salvation at his firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Incarnation. It is not enough to ſtudy and know theſe great Myſteries; but according to the Meaſure of Knowledge we have, we muſt Muſe, Meditate, Ponder, and Conſider of them. Now this Conſideration brings Chriſt nearer and cloſer to the ſoul. <hi>Conſideration</hi> gathers up all the long fore-paſſed Acts and Monuments of Chriſt, and finds a deal of ſweetneſs and power to come flowing from them. Conſideration faſtens Chriſt more ſtrongly to the Soul, and as it were, rivets the Soul to Jeſus Chriſt, and faſtens him in the heart. A ſoul that truly conſiders and meditates of Chriſt, thinks and talkes of nothing elſe but Chriſt;<note place="margin">Prov. 4.13.</note> it takes hold, and will not let him go. <hi>I will keep to thee</hi> (ſaith the ſoul in meditation) <hi>for thou art my life.</hi> Why thus, O my Soul, <hi>conſider</hi> thou of Chriſt, and of what he did for thee when he was incarnate! and that thou maiſt not confound thy ſelf in thy meditations, conſider a part of theſe particulars. — As, —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider Jeſus in his Fore-runner, and the bleſſed tidings of his coming in the fleſh; now the long-looked for time drew near, a glorious Angel is ſent from Heaven, and he comes with an Olive-branch of peace; firſt he preſents himſelf to <hi>Zachary,</hi> and then to <hi>Mary;</hi> to her he imparts the Meſſage on which God ſent him into this neather World; <hi>Behold thou ſhalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and ſhalt call his name Jeſus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1.31.</note> Till now Humane Nature was leſs than that of Angels; but by the Incarnation of the Word, it was to be exalted above the Cherubims. What ſweet News? What bleſſed Tidings was this Meſſage? The Decree of old muſt now be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94897:79"/> accompliſhed, and an <hi>Angel</hi> proclaims it upon Earth; hear O ye Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you as much as the Virgin: Were ye not all undone in the Loins of your firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Was not my Soul, and thy Soul in danger of Hell-fire; was not this our caſe and condition; that after a little life upon Earth, we ſhould have been thrown into eternal torments, where had been nothing but Weeping, Wailing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth? And now that God and Chriſt ſhould bid an <hi>Angel</hi> tell the News, <hi>Ye ſhall not die; lo, here a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and he ſhall be your Jeſus; he ſhall ſave you from this Hell, and Death, and Sin: he ſhall deliver your Souls, he ſhall ſave you to the utmoſt; his Name is Jeſus, and he ſhall not bear his Name for nought; believe in him, and ye ſhall live with him in Glory.</hi> O bleſſed news! Men may talk what they will of this and that news, every one gapes after it: but there is no news ſo welcome to one even now ready to periſh, as to hear of a Saviour; tell a man in his Sickneſs of one that will make him well again: tell a man in Captivity of one that will reſcue him, and ſet him free again; tell a man in Priſon, condemned to die, of one with a pardon, that will ſave his life; and every one of theſe will ſay, this is the beſt news that ever was heard: O then, if it be good tidings to hear of a Saviour, where is only a matter of loſs of life, or of this Earth; how much more when it comes to the loſs of Heaven, to the danger of Hell, when our Souls are at ſtake, and likely to be damned for evermore; what glad tidings would that be to hear of one that could ſave our ſouls from that deſtroyer? is not ſuch a Saviour worth the hearkning after? were not the birth of ſuch a one good news? O my ſoul, ponder on theſe words, as if an <hi>Angel,</hi> ſeeing thee ſtand on the brim of Hell, ſhould ſpeak to thee, even to thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his Conception; no ſooner the news heard, but Chriſt is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Holy Ghoſt in the Virgins Womb; this Conception is worthy our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: what, that the great God of Heaven ſhould condeſcend ſo far as to take our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, and to take it in the ſame way, and after the ſame manner as we do? the Womb of the Virgin was ſurely no ſuch place, but he might well have abhorred it; true, but he meant by this to ſanctifie our very Conceptions; and to that purpoſe, he is conceived in an holy manner, even by the holy Ghoſt; we muſt not be too curious to enquire after the manner of the holy Ghoſts operation, who therefore overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the Virgin; this is work for our hearts, and not meerly for our heads: hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Faith, and not curious inquiſition ſhall find the ſweetneſs of this Myſtery. It was <hi>Davids</hi> Complaint, <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> O my Soul, this was thy caſe in thy very firſt being or beginning,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> and hadſt thou died in that condition, the word is expreſs, that <hi>nothing defiled nor unclean ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City of Glory;</hi> but here's the remedy, thy ſinful Conception is ſanctified by Chriſts holy Conception: the holineſs of thy <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſerves as a Cover to hide thy Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal pollutions from the eyes of God. O conſider this! Jeſus Chriſt was not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in vain; he was not idle, doing nothing whiles he was in his Mothers Womb; he that from all eternity began, he was then carrying on the great work of our ſalvation for us: O conſider this Conception thus, till thou bring'ſt it near and cloſe to thy ſoul; till thou feeleſt ſome ſweetneſs and power coming, and flowing from Jeſus in the Womb.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider the duplicity of Natures in Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>The Word was made Fleſh;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.14.</note> no ſooner was he conceived, but he was God-Man, Man-God; he was perfectly framed, and inſtantly united to the eternal Word: <hi>God ſent his Son,</hi> there's the Nature Divine; <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> there's the Nature Humane. Certainly great is this Myſtery, that the Word is made Fleſh; that the Son of God is made of a Woman;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> that a Star gives Light to the Sun; that a Branch doth bear the Vine; that a Creature gives being to the Creator; that the Mother was younger than what ſhe bear, and a great deal leſſer than what ſhe contained. Admire O my Soul at this! but withal conſider, that all this was for us and our Salvation; he was Man, that he might die for us: and he was God, that his death might be ſufficient to ſave us: had he been Man alone, not God, he might have ſuffered, but he could never have ſatisfied for ſin; he could not have been <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a Saviour of Souls; and had he been God alone, not Man, he had not been of kin to our Nature offending; and ſo he could not have ſatisfied the Juſtice of God in the ſame Nature wherein it was offended; neither could he, as God alone, have died for Sin; and the Decree was out, that our Redeemer muſt die for Sin: <hi>for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of Blood there is no Remiſſion:</hi> and no ſhedding of Blood,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> no Paſſion could
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94897:80"/> poſſibly befal the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt. I ſhall not diſpute the power of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was able to lay down another kind of way of mans Redemption, than by the Incarnation of the Son of God: without controverſie this was the Will of God, and he appointed no other way, becauſe he would not. O my Soul, conſider of this in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thy ſelf, he is God-man, that he might ſuffer and ſatisfie for thy ſins: he is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he might be able and fit, moſt fully to finiſh the work of thy ſalvation; as God, he is able, and as man, he is fit to diſcharge the Office of Mediator; as God, he is able to bear the puniſhment of ſin; and as man, he is fit to ſuffer for ſin: O the wiſdom of God in this very way! Mans Nature can ſuffer Death, but not overcome it; the Divine Nature can overcome death and all things; but he cannot ſuffer it: and hence there is a duplicity of natures in Jeſus Chriſt: O muſe on this; it is a matter worthy of thy ſerious conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider the real diſtinction of theſe two Natures in Chriſt. As the unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable light of the God-head was put into the dim and dark Lanthorn of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh, ſo theſe two natures remained entire, without any converſion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixion, or confuſion; they were not as Wine and Water, that become one by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; there is no ſuch blending the divine and humane nature; they were not as Snow and Water, that become one by diſſolving of the Snow into the Water; there is no ſuch changing of the Humane Nature into the Divine, or of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature into the Humane: Some ſay indeed, that the God-head was more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully communicated with the Manhood after his Reſurrection, than now at his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; but howſoever, it did not then ſwallow up the Truth of his Manhood, as a whole Sea would ſwallow up one drop of Oyl; look as at firſt moment of his Conception, he was God and man, ſo theſe two Natures continued ſtill, diſtinct in ſubſtance, properties, and actions. Why conſider this, O my ſoul, in reference to thy ſelf; O ther's comfort in this! by this meanes thou haſt now free acceſs unto the Throne of Grace, that thou mayeſt find help in thy neceſſities; and as thou haſt free acceſs, ſo thou mayeſt boldly draw near; his Deity indeed confounds, but his Humanity comforts faint and feeble Souls; his Divine Nature amazeth, but his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature incourageth us to come unto him; even after his Reſurrection he was pleaſed to ſend this comfortable meſſage to the ſons of men,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Go to my Brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your</hi> God; now as long as he is not aſhamed to call us Brethren,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.16.</note> God <hi>is not aſhamed to be called our</hi> God. O the ſweet fruit, that we may gather of this Tree, <hi>the real diſtinction of two Natures in Chriſt.</hi> As long as Chriſt is man as well as God, we have a motive ſtrong enough to appeaſe his Father, and to turn his favourable countenance towards us; here is our happineſs, that <hi>there is one Mediator between</hi> God <hi>and Man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.5.</note> 
                     <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. conſider the Union of the two natures of Chriſt in one and the ſame Perſon; as he was the branch of the Lord, and the fruit of the Earth, ſo theſe two natures were tied with ſuch a Gordian knot, as ſin, hell, and the grave were never able to untie; yea, though in the death of Chriſt there was a ſeparation of the ſoul from the body; yet in that ſeparation, the hypoſtatical Union remained firm, unſhaken and indiſſoluble: in this Meditation thou haſt great cauſe, O my Soul, to admire and adore; wonderful things are ſpoken of thee, O Chriſt! he is God in a Perſon of a God-head, ſo as neither the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt were made fleſh; and he is man in the nature of man, not properly the Perſon, the humane nature of Chriſt never having any Perſonal ſubſiſtence out of the God-head; this is a myſtery, that no Angel, much leſs man is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend: we have not another example of ſuch an Union (as you have heard) only the neareſt ſimilitude, or reſemblance we can find, is that of the Branch and Tree into which it is ingraffed; we ſee one Tree may be ſet into another, and it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Stock thereof, and becometh one and the ſame Tree, though there be two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or kinds of fruit ſtill remaining therein; ſo in the Son of God made man, though there be two natures, yet both being united into one Perſon, there is but one Son of God and one Jeſus Chriſt. If thou wilt conſider this <hi>great myſtery of</hi> Godlineſs any further, review what hath been ſaid in the object propounded, where this union is ſet forth more largely and particularly; but eſpecially conſider the bleſſed effects of this union in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to thy ſelf; as our nature in the perſon of Chriſt, is united to the God-head, ſo our perſons in and by this Union of Chriſt, are brought nigh to God. Hence it is that God doth ſet his Sanctuary and Tabernacle among us; and that he dwells with us; and which is more, that he makes us houſes and habitations, wherein he himſelf is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94897:80"/> pleaſed to dwell by his holy Spirit. <hi>Ye are the Temple of the Living God, as God hath ſaid I will dewll in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 17 20, 21, 22, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>and they ſhall be my People,</hi> 2. Cor. 6.16. Was not this Chriſts Prayer in our behalf? <hi>I pray not for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word, that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in one, and that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi> By reaſon of this hypoſtatical union of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note> the Spirit of Chriſt is given to us in the very moment of our regeneration. <hi>And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba Father; and hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi> As the members of the Body howſoever diſtinct amongſt themſelves, and all differing from the head, yet by reaſon of one ſoul informing both the head and members, they all make one <hi>compoſitum,</hi> or man; ſo all believers in Chriſt, howſoever diſtinct Perſons amongſt themſelves, and all diſtinct from the Perſon of Chriſt, and eſpecially from the Godhead which is incommunicable, yet by one and the ſame ſpirit abiding in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.4. 1 Cor. 6.17.</note> and all his Members, they become one, <hi>there is one body, and one</hi> ſpirit: <hi>he that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> O my Soul, conſider of this; and in conſidering, believe thy part in this, and the rather, becauſe the means of this union on thy part is a true and lively faith; faith is the firſt effect and inſtrument of the Spirit of Chriſt, diſpoſing and enabling thy ſoul to cleave unto Chriſt, and <hi>for this cauſe I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt —that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider the birth of Chriſt, this man-God, God-man, who in his divine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was the Son of God, in his humane generation was born in a ſtable, for the ſaving of the Children of men, who were as the oxe and mule having no underſtanding. It were a fruitful meditation to conſider over and over that ſweet reſemblance of Chriſt being <hi>a Vine;</hi> me-thinks I hear the Voice of my beloved,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.10, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>riſe up my love—the fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vine with the tender grapes gives a good ſmell; ariſe my love, my fair one, and come away;</hi> if Chriſt knocks at the door, who will not awake, and ariſe? if Chriſt comes in view, who will not <hi>look unto Jeſus?</hi> if Chriſt the Vine calls us to come ſee the vine with the tender grape, who will not taſte the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſmell the ſweetneſs? and after a little taſte of that goodneſs, and ſweetneſs that is in him, who would not long after more, till we come from the firſt fruits to the laſt-fruits of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> even to thoſe viſions and fruitions of Chriſt in Glory? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, O my ſoul, of this Vine, till thou haſt brought Chriſt near and cloſe unto thy ſelf. Suppoſe thy heart, the Garden wherein this Vine was planted, wherein it budded, bloſſomed, and bare fruit, ſuppoſe the holy Ghoſt to come upon thee, and to form and faſhion in thee Jeſus Chriſt; (thus <hi>Paul</hi> beſpeaks the <hi>Galathians, my little Children, of whom I travel in Birth again untill Chriſt be formed in you,</hi>) would not this affect? would not the whole ſoul be taken up with this? come, receive Chriſt into thy ſoul, or if that work be done, if Chriſt be formed in thee, O Cheriſh him! (I ſpeak of the Spiritual birth) O keep him in thy heart! let him there bud, and bloſſome, and bear fruit; let him fill thy ſoul, with his Divine Graces; O that thou couldſt ſay it feelingly, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> O that this were the Iſſue of thy meditation on Chriſts Birth! even whiles thou art going with the ſhepherds to <hi>Bethelem,</hi> and there findeſt thy Saviour lying in a Cratch, that thou wouldſt bring him thence, and make thy heart to be his Cradle! I would not give a farthing for a meditation meerly on the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Birth; either draw vertue from him, by feeling him within, or thy meditation will be fruitleſs.—</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider thoſe few conſequents after <hi>Chriſts</hi> Birth; every action of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our inſtruction; here are many particulars, but none in vain; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is conſidered under much variety of notion, but he is ſtill ſweet under all. Is it poſſible, O my ſoul, that thou ſhouldſt tyre thy ſelf in the contemplations of Jeſus Chriſt? if one flower yield thee not pleaſure, or delight, go to a ſecond, a third; obſerve how the Bees gather honey, after a while that they have ſucked one flower, they go to another; ſo for a while obſerve the circumciſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſuck there, and gather ſome honey out of that flower; <hi>Chriſt</hi> had never been, Circumciſed but that the ſame might be done to our ſouls, that was done to his Body, O that the ſame <hi>Chriſt</hi> would do that in us, that was done to him for us. Again, obſerve <hi>Chriſts</hi> preſentation in the Temple, this was the Law of thoſe that firſt opened the womb; now <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94897:81"/> of <hi>Mary,</hi> and indeed <hi>the firſt-born of all Creatures;</hi> and he was conſecrate unto God, that by him we might be conſecrate, and made holy; and that by him we might be accepted, when we are offered unto the Lord. Again, obſerve Chriſts flight into <hi>Egypt;</hi> though the infancy is uſually moſt quiet, and devoyd of trouble, yet here life and toyle, began together; and ſee how ſpeedily this comes after Chriſts dedication unto God: Alas! Alas! We are no ſooner born again, then we are perſecuted; if the Church travel, and bring forth a Male, ſhe is in danger of the Dragons ſtreams. Again, obſerve Chriſt's return into <hi>Judea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 15.25.</note> he <hi>was not ſent but to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael;</hi> with them alone he was perſonally to converſe in his Miniſtry, in which reſpect he was called a <hi>Miniſter of Circumciſion.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.8.</note> And where ſhould he be trained, and ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but amongſt them to whom God had ſent him? The Goſpel firſt began there, and as a preparation to it, Chriſt now in his Childhood returns thither. Again, obſerve Chriſt Diſputing with the Doctors in the Temple; in his very non-age Chriſt gives a taſte of his future proof, ſee how early his divine graces put forth themſelves, <hi>In Him were hid</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge;</hi>

It is not enough to know, and conſider, but we muſt <hi>deſire.</hi> Now, What is <hi>deſire, but a certain Motion of the Appetite, by which the Soul darts it ſelf towards the abſent good, purpoſely to draw near, and to unite it ſelf thereunto?</hi> The incarnation of Chriſt according to the Letter, was <hi>the deſire of Nations;</hi> ſo the Prophet,<note place="margin">Hag. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>I will ſhake all Nations, and the Deſire of all Nations ſhall come.</hi> O how they that lived before Chriſt, Deſired after this coming of Chriſt! <hi>Abraham</hi> Deſired to ſee that day, Two Thouſand Years and more before it came: it was the expectation of all the Patriarchs, <hi>O when will that day come?</hi> And ſurely the incarnation of Chriſt in the fruit, or efficacy, or application is, or ſhould be the Deſire of all Chriſtians. There is merit, and vertue in Jeſus Chriſt, in every paſſage of Chriſt, in his conception, incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; in his birth, and in thoſe conſequents after his birth; now to make theſe ours, that we may have our ſhare, and part, and intereſt in them, we muſt here begin; O my ſoul do thou <hi>deſire,</hi> do thou ſeek to poſſeſs thy ſelf of Chriſt, ſet thy <hi>deſire</hi> (as the Needle point) aright, and all the reſt will follow: never will union be with the abſent good, but the Soul by Deſire, muſt firſt dart it ſelf towards it. True it is, and pity it is, Millions of Souls ſtand at a diſtance from Jeſus Chriſt, and why? they have no deſire towards him: but, O that my ſoul, and thy ſoul (whoſoever thou art that readeſt) would Deſire! O that we could Deſire, and long after him until we languiſh, and be compelled to cry out with the ſpouſe,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.5.</note>

                  <p>Is there not good reaſon for it? What is there in Chriſt that is not Deſirable? view over all thoſe excellencies of his conception; of his two natures, really diſtinguiſhed, and yet wonderfully united; of his birth; of thoſe few conſequents after his birth:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94897:81"/> but above all, ſee the fruit of all; he was conceived that our conceptions might be ſanctified: he was the Son of man that he might ſuffer for us, and the Son of God that he might ſatisfie divine juſtice: he was God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Man in one perſon, that we might be one with him, <hi>Members of his Body, and of his Fleſh, and of his Bones;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5.30.</note> he was born of the Virgin, that there might be a ſpiritual conception and birth of Chriſt in our Virgin-hearts; or he was conceived, and born that we might conceive the grace of Chriſt in our hearts, and bring it forth in our lives; What? Are not theſe deſirable things? Never tell me of thy preſent enjoyments, for never was Chriſt ſo enjoyed in this life, but thou haſt cauſe to deſire yet more of Chriſt; It is worth thy obſervation, that <hi>Spiritual deſires after Chriſt, do neither load, nor cloy the heart, but rather open, and enlarge it for more and more;</hi> Who was better acquainted with God than <hi>Moſes?</hi>

That Mercy and Truth met together, and Righteouſneſs and Peace kiſſed each other?</hi> an higher degree of holineſs, ſanctification, likeneſs to God and Chriſt are deſirable things; and are not theſe the fruits of his circumciſion, and preſentation to the Lord? the effects of all thoſe conſequents that follow after his birth? Come, Soul, and ſtir up thy deſires; true deſires are not wavering and dull, but reſolute and full of quickneſs; obſerve how the nature of true deſires in Scripture is ſet forth by the moſt pathetical and ſtrong ſimilitudes of <hi>Hunger and Thirſt,</hi> and thoſe not common neither, but by <hi>The panting of a tyred Hart after the rivers of waters,</hi> and by <hi>the gaping of dry ground after ſome ſeaſonable ſhowers.</hi> O then!

                     <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Of Hoping in Jeſus in that Reſpect.</head>
                  <p n="4">4. LEt us <hi>Hope in Jeſus,</hi> carrying on the great Work of our Salvation at his firſt coming, or incarnation. Only here remember, I ſpeak not of every <hi>hope,</hi> but only of ſuch an <hi>hope</hi> as is grounded on ſome certainty and knowledge. This is the main queſtion, whether Chriſts incarnation belongs unto me? the Prophet tells us, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born, and unto us a Son is given.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.</note> But how may I Hope that this Child
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94897:82"/> is born to me? and that this Son is given to me? what ground for that? Out of theſe words of the Prophet, I ſhall draw a double Evidence, which may be inſtead of all: our firſt Evidence from the former words, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born;</hi> our ſecond Evidence from the latter words, <hi>unto us a Son is given.</hi> 1. From the former words I lay down this poſition, <hi>unto us a Child is born, if we are new born;</hi> the ſureſt way to know our intereſt in the birth of Chriſt, it is to know Chriſt born in us, or <hi>formed in us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. The new birth is the effect of Chriſts birth, and a ſure ſign that Chriſt is born to us. Say then, O my ſoul, Art thou born anew? is there in thee a new nature, a new principle? is the Image of God, and of Chriſt in thy ſoul? ſo the Apoſtle ſtiles it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.59.</note> 
                     <hi>the bearing of the Image of the heavenly;</hi> why then was Chriſt incarnate for thee; if thy new birth be not clear enough, thou may'ſt try it further by theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing rules?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Where this new birth is, there is new deſires, new comforts, new contentments. Sometimes with the prodigal thou waſt content with husks, but now nothing will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thee, but thy Fathers manſion, and thy Fathers feaſts; ſometimes thou mindeſt only earthly things, but now the favour of God, the light of his countenance, ſociety with him, and enjoying of him, are thy chief deſires; This is a good ſign! <hi>David</hi>'s heart and fleſh,<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.2.</note> and all breathed after God; <hi>My ſoul longeth; yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord, my heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God.</hi> Men truly regenerate, do not judge it ſo happy to be wealthy, great, and honoured in the world, as to have the light of Gods favour ſhine upon them; O my ſoul, doſt thou ſee the glory of the world, and thou falleſt down to worſhip it? doſt thou ſay in the increaſe of worldly comfort, it is good to be here? Then fear thy ſelf; but if theſe things compared with Chriſt, are vain, and light, and of poor and mean eſteem, then hope well, and be aſſured that thou art born again, and that Chriſt is formed in thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where this new birth is, there is new words, new works, new affections, a new converſation,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17. Acts 9.11. 1 Cor. 6.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Old things are paſſed away, behold, all things are become new. Paul</hi> once a perſecutor, but <hi>Behold now he prayeth.</hi> And <hi>Such were ſome of you, but now ye are waſhed, now ye are ſanctified, now ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God;</hi> As every man is, ſo is he affected, ſo he ſpeaks, and ſo he lives; if thy life be ſupernatural, ſo is thy affections, ſo is thy words, ſo is thy converſation; <hi>Paul</hi> lived a life once of a bloody perſecutor, he breathed out threatenings againſt all the Profeſſors of the Lord Jeſus, but now it is otherwiſe; <hi>The life which I now live in the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                     <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> O my ſoul, Haſt thou the old converſation, the old affections, the old diſcourſe, the old paſſions thou uſed to have? What? Is thy heart a den of luſts, a cage of unclean ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations? Then fear thy ſelf, there cannot from a ſweet fountain come forth bitter ſtreams; there cannot from a refined ſpirit, as refined, come forth corrupted actions or imaginations; <hi>a Thorn cannot ſend forth Grapes,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; ſo neither can a Vine ſend forth Thornes, ſay we. I know there is in the beſt, ſomething of fleſh, as well as of the ſpirit; but if thou art new born, then thou canſt not but ſtrive againſt it, and wilt endeavour to conquer it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.4. 2 Pet. 1.4. Rom. 7.22. 2 Cor. 5.17.</note>3. Where this new birth is, there is a new nature, a new principle; <hi>Peter</hi> calls it <hi>the hidden man of the heart, the divine nature. Paul</hi> calls it <hi>the inward man; the new creature,</hi> it is compared to a <hi>root,</hi> to a <hi>fountain,</hi> to a <hi>foundation,</hi> and for want of this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſee now in theſe ſad times ſo much inconſtancy, and unſetledneſs in ſome profeſſors themſelves, many have gotten new and ſtrange notions, but they have not new natures, new principles of grace; if grace were but rooted in their hearts, though the winds did blow, and ſtorms ariſe, they would continue firm and ſtable, as being founded upon a Rock. Never tell me of profeſſion, ſhew, outward action, outward converſation, outward duties of Religion; all this may be, and yet no new creature; you have ſome bruits that can act many things like men, but becauſe they have not an humane nature, they are ſtill bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh; ſo many things may be done in a way of holineſs, which yet come not from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of renovation, and therefore it is but copper, and not gold; miſtake not O my ſoul in this, which is thy beſt and ſureſt evidence: though I call the new birth <hi>a new creature,</hi> my meaning is not as if a new faculty were infuſed into him that is new born; a man when he is regenerate, hath no more faculties in his ſoul than he had before his regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; only in the work of regeneration, thoſe ablities which the man had before, are now improved, and made ſpiritual; and ſo they work now ſpiritually, which before wrought naturally. As in the reſurrection from the dead, our bodies ſhall have no more,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94897:82"/> nor other parts and members than they had before, only thoſe parts and members which now are natural, ſhall then by the power of God be made ſpiritual,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.44.</note> 
                     <hi>It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body;</hi> ſo the ſame faculties, and the ſame abilities which before regeneration were but natural, are now ſpiritual, and work ſpiritually, they are all brought under the government of the Spirit of Chriſt; a lively reſemblance of this change in the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul, we may diſcern in thoſe natural and ſenſitive faculties, which we have common with beaſts; as to live, to move, to deſire, to feel, the beaſts having no higher principle than ſenſe, uſe them ſenſually; but a man enjoying the ſame faculties under the command of a reaſonable ſoul, he uſeth them rationally: ſo is it in a regenerate man; his underſtanding, will, and affections, when they had no other command but reaſon, he only uſed them rationally, but now being under the guiding of the Spirit of Chriſt, they work ſpiritually, and he uſeth them ſpiritually; and hence it is that a regenerate man is every where in Scripture,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1. Gal. 5.18, 25.</note> ſaid to <hi>Walk after the Spirit;</hi> to <hi>be led by the Spirit,</hi> to <hi>walk in the Spirit;</hi> the Spirit (by way of infuſing or ſhedding) gives power, an ability, a ſeed, a principle of ſpiritual life, which the ſoul had not before; and from this principle of ſpiritual life planted in the Soul, flows or ſprings thoſe ſpiritual motions and operations (as the Spirit leads them out) according to the habit, or principle of the new creature, the divine nature, the ſpiritual life infuſed. Come then, look to it O my ſoul, What is thy principle within? conſider not ſo much the outward actions, the outward duties of Religion, as, that root from whence they grow, that principle from whence they come: they are fixed ones, ſetled ones by way of life in thee? Clocks have their motions, but they are not motions of life, becauſe they have no principles of life within. Is there life within? then art thou born again, yea even <hi>unto thee a Child is born.</hi> This is one evidence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the latter words, I lay down this poſition; <hi>unto us a Son is given, if we are Gods Sons.</hi> The beſt way to know our Intereſt in the Son of God, it is to know our ſelves to be Gods Sons by grace, as Chriſt was Gods Son by nature: Chriſtians to whom Chriſt is given, are coheirs with Chriſt, only Chriſt is the firſt-born, and hath the preheminence in all things; our ſonſhip is an effect of Chriſts ſonſhip, and a ſure ſign that <hi>unto us a Son is given.</hi> Say then, O my ſoul, Art thou a Son of God? Doſt thou reſemble God (according to thy capacity) being holy, even as he is holy? Why then? Chriſt was incarnate for thee, he was given to thee. If thy ſonſhip be not clear enough, thou mayſt try it further by theſe following Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Sons of God, Fear God, <hi>If I be a Father, Where is my Honour?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 1.6.</note> (ſaith God) <hi>if I be a Maſter, Where is my Fear?</hi> If I be a Son of God, there will be an holy Fear and Trembling upon me in all my approaches unto God. I know there is a ſervile merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fear, and that is unworthy, and unbeſeeming the Son of God; but there is a filial Fear, and that is an excellent check, and bridle to all our wantonneſs: What Son will not Fear the frowns and anger of his loving Father?<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.17.</note> 
                     <hi>I dare not do this</hi> (will he ſay) <hi>my Father will be offended; and I, whether ſhall I go?</hi> Agreeable to this is the Apoſtles advice, <hi>If ye call on the Father, paſs your ſojourning here with Fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Sons of God Love God, and Obey God out of a principle of Love. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were no Heaven, or Glory to beſtow upon a regenerate perſon, yet would he Obey God out of a principle of Love; not that it is unlawful for the Child of God to have an Eye unto the recompence of reward;<note place="margin">Heb. 11.26.</note> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> reaſon of <hi>eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſure of</hi> Egypt, was, <hi>for that he had reſpect unto the recompence of reward:</hi> he had reſpect, in the original, <hi>he had a fixed intent Eye;</hi> there was in him a Love of the reward, and yet withal a Love of God, and therefore his Love of the reward was not mercinary: but this, I ſay, though there were no reward at all, a Child of God hath ſuch a principle of Love within him, that for Loves ſake he would Obey his God; he is led by the Spirit, and therefore he Obeys; now the Spirit that leads him, is a Spirit of Love; and <hi>as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of</hi> God.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Sons of God imitate God in his Love and Goodneſs to all Men. Our Saviour amplifies this excellent property of God, <hi>He cauſeth his Sun to ſhine upon good and bad;</hi> and thence he concludeth, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5.48.</note> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to bad men is the higheſt degree of Grace, and as it were the perfection of all: O my Soul, Canſt thou imitate God in this? Conſider how thy Father bears it; though the wicked provoke him day by day, yet for all that he doth not quickly revenge;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94897:83"/> vengeance indeed is only his, and he may in juſtice do what he will that way; and 'tis the opinion of ſome, that if the moſt patient man in the world ſhould but ſit in Gods Throne one day, and ſee, and obſerve the doings, and miſcarriges of the Sons of Men, he would quickly ſet all the World on Fire; yet God ſeeth all, and for all that He doth not make the Earth preſently to gape, and devour us; He puts not out the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Light of the Sun, He doth not diſſolve the Work of Creation, He doth not for Mans Sin preſently blaſt every thing into Duſt: What an excellent pattern is this for thee to Write after? Canſt thou but forgive thy Enemies? Do well to them that do evil to thee? O this is a ſure ſign of Grace and Sonſhip! It is ſtoryed of ſome Heathens, who beating a Chriſtian almoſt to Death, asked him, <hi>What great matter Chriſt did ever do for him?</hi> Even this (ſaid the Chriſtian) <hi>That I can forgive you, though you uſe me thus cruelly;</hi> here was a Child of God indeed: It is a ſweet reſemblance of our Father, and of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to <hi>Love our Enemies, to Bleſs them that Curſe us, to do Good unto them that Hate us, to Pray for them that Deſpitefully uſe us, and Perſecute us.</hi> O my Soul look to this,<note place="margin">5.44.</note> conſult this ground of Hope; if this Law be written in thy Heart, write it down amongſt thy Evidences, that thou art Gods Son, yea that even unto thee a Son is given.</p>
                  <p>To Review the Grounds: What? is a Child born to me? and a Son given to me? What? am I indeed new born? am I indeed Gods Son, or Daughter? do I upon the ſearch find in my Soul new deſires, new comforts, new contentments? What? are my words, my works, and affections, and converſation new? is there in me a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a new principle? hath the Spirit by way of infuſing or ſhedding, given me a new Power, a new Ability, a Seed of Spiritual Life, which I had not before? do I upon the ſearch find that I fear God, and love God, and imitate God in ſome good meaſure in his love and goodneſs towards all Men? can I indeed, and really forgive an Enemy, and according to opportunity and my ability, do good unto them that do evil unto me? Why ſhould I not then confidently and comfortably <hi>hope,</hi> that I have my ſhare and intereſt in the birth of Chriſt, in the bleſſed incarnation, and conception of Jeſus Chriſt? Away, away all deſpair, and dejections, and deſpondencies of Spirit! If theſe be my grounds of Hope, it is time to hold up head, and heart, and hands, and all with cheerfulneſs and confidence, and to ſay with the Spouſe, <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The exceeding unworthineſs of the ſoul; and to this purpoſe are thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <hi>What? Chriſt incarnate for me? for ſuch a dead Dog as I am? What King would dethrone himſelf, and become a Toad to ſave Toades? and am not I at a greater diſtance from God, than a Toad is from me? hath not ſin made my ſoul more ugly in Gods Eye, than any loathſome Toad can be in my Eye? O I am leſs than the leaſt of all Gods Mercies, I am fitter for Hell and Devils, than for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion with God and Chriſt, I dare not, I cannot Believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The infinite exactneſs of divine juſtice which muſt be ſatisfied; a ſoul deeply and ſeriouſly conſidering of this, it ſtartles thereat, and cries, O what will become of my ſoul? one of the leaſt ſins that I ſtand Guilty of, deſerves Death, and eternal Wrath, <hi>The wages of ſin is death:</hi> and I cannot ſatisfie; though I have treſpaſſed to many millions of talents, I have not one mite of mine own to pay; O then how ſhould I believe? What thoughts can I entertain of Gods Mercy and Love to me-ward?
<pb facs="tcp:94897:83"/> God's Law condemns me, my own Conſcience accuſeth me, and Juſtice will have its due.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The want of a Mediator, or ſome ſuitable Perſon, which may ſtand between the Sinner and God. If on my part there be unworthineſs, and on Gods part exact and ſtrict, and ſevere Juſtice; and withall I ſee no Mediator, which I may go unto, and firſt cloſe withall before I deal with the infinite glory of God himſelf, how ſhould I but deſpair, and cry out? <hi>O wretched man that I am! O that I had never been! or if I muſt needs have a being; Oh that I had been a toad, or ſerpent, or any venomous creature rather than a man; for when they dye they periſh, and there's an end of them; but the end of a reprobate ſinner is torments without end: O wo and alas! I cannot believe, there's no room for faith in this caſe!</hi> theſe are the hinderances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The helps of faith in this ſad condition are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A conſideration that God is pleaſed to paſs by, and to overlook the unworthineſs of his poor creatures; this we ſee plain in the very act of his incarnation; himſelf diſdains not to be as his poor creatures, to wear their own fleſh, to take upon him humane nature; and in all things to become like unto man, ſin only excepted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A conſideration that God ſatisfies Juſtice, by ſetting up Chriſt who is Juſtice it ſelf; now was it that <hi>mercy and truth met together, and righteouſneſs and peace kiſſed each other;</hi> now was it that free grace and merit, that fulneſs and nothingneſs were made one; now was it that all things became nothing, and nothing all things; our nature which lay in rags, was enriched with the unſearchable treaſures of glory; now was it that God was made fleſh; and ſo that fleſh which was ſo weak, as not able to ſave its own life, was now enabled to ſave millions of ſouls, and to bring forth the greateſt deſigns of God; now was it that truth ran to mercy, and embraced her, and righteouſneſs to peace, and kiſſed her, in Chriſt they meet, yea in him was the infinite exactneſs of God's Juſtice ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A conſideration that God hath ſet up Chriſt as a Mediator: that he was incarnate in order to reconciliation, and ſalvation of ſouls, but for the accompliſhment of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign Chriſt had never been incarnate; the very end of his uniting fleſh unto him, was in order to the reconciliation of us poor ſouls, alas we had ſinned, and by ſin deſerved ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting damnation, but to ſave us, and to ſatisfie himſelf, God takes our nature and joyns it to his Son, and calls that <hi>Chriſt a Saviour:</hi> This is the Goſpel-notion of Chriſt, for what is Chriſt, but <hi>God himſelf in our nature, tranſacting our peace?</hi> In this Chriſt is that fulneſs, and righteouſneſs, and love, and bowels to receive the firſt acts of our faith; and to have immediate union and communion with us; indeed we pitch not our faith firſt or immediately on God himſelf; yet at laſt we come to him, and our faith lives in God (as one ſaith ſweetly) before it is aware, through the ſweet intervention of that perſon which is God himſelf, only called by another name, <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and theſe are the helps of faith in reference to our unworthineſs, Gods juſtice, and the want of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betwixt God and us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The manner how to act our faith on Chriſt incarnate, is this—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith muſt directly go to Chriſt: we find indeed in the Bible ſome particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this and that grace: and in proper ſpeaking the way to live by faith, it is to live upon the promiſes in the want of the thing, or to apprehend the thing it ſelf contained in the promiſe: but the promiſes are not given to the elect immediately without Chriſt; no, no, firſt Chriſt, and then all other things, <hi>Encline your ears, and come unto me;</hi> 1. Come unto Chriſt, and then, <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> (which contains all the promiſes) <hi>even the ſure Mercies of David.</hi> As in marriage, the woman firſt conſents to have the man, and then all the benefits that neceſſarily follow; ſo the ſoul by faith, firſt pitcheth upon Chriſt himſelf, and then on the priviledges that flow from Chriſt. Say Soul, doſt thou want any temporal Bleſſing? ſuppoſe it be the payment of Debts, thy dayly Bread, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why? look now through the Scripture for promiſes of theſe things, and let thy faith act thus, <hi>If God hath given me Chriſt, the greateſt bleſſing, then certainly he will give me all theſe things ſo far as they may be for my good:</hi> in the twenty thirſt Pſalm we find a bundle of promiſes, but he begins thus, <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> and what then? <hi>Therefore I ſhall not want;</hi> the believing Patriarchs through faith <hi>ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtoped the mouths of Lyons,</hi> did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the world; but what did they chiefly look to in this their Faith? Surely to <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to come,</hi> and to that <hi>better thing,</hi> Chriſt himſelf; and therefore the Apoſtle concludes, <hi>having ſuch a cloud of witneſſes,</hi> that thus lived and died by faith, <hi>let us look unto Jeſus, the Author and finiſher of our Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:94897:84"/>2. Faith muſt directly go to Chriſt as God in our fleſh; ſome think it a carnal appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Jeſus Chriſt, to know him as in fleſh; I confeſs to know him only ſo, and abſolutely ſo; to conſider Jeſus no other way, but as having fleſh, and going up and down in weakneſs; it is no better than a carnal apprehenſion; but to conſider Chriſt as God in fleſh, and to conſider that fleſh as acted by God, and filled with God, it is not a carnal, but a true and ſpiritual apprehenſion of Jeſus Chriſt; and hither is faith to be directed immediately, and in the firſt place; ſuppoſe a caſe of danger by ſome enemies, and I find a promiſe of protection from my enemies, I look on that; but in the firſt place thus I argue, if the Lord hath given me Chriſt (God in the fleſh) to ſave me from Hell, then much more will he ſave me from theſe fleſhly enemies. Thus <hi>Juda</hi> had a promiſe, that <hi>Syria</hi> ſhould not prevail againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> they doubted of this,<note place="margin">Iſa. 7.14.</note> but how doth the Lord ſeek to aſſure them? why thus, <hi>a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and his name ſhall be Immanuel:</hi> this ſeems a ſtrong reaſon to fleſh and blood; I knew one turn Infidel, and to deny Jeſus Chriſt upon this very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Ah (thought he) what a grand impoſture is this, that Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>conception, and Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>birth many years after, ſhould be a preſent ſign of ruin of</hi> Rezin <hi>King of</hi> Aram, <hi>and of the preſervation of</hi> Ahaz <hi>King of</hi> Judah? alas poor ſoul, he was not acquainted with this art of <hi>living by faith;</hi> he might have ſeen the very ſame reaſon elſewhere, <hi>the yoke of their burthen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 9.4, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and the ſtuff of their ſhoulder, and the rod of their oppreſſor ſhall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken—for unto us a child is born, and unto us a Son is given;</hi> if their faith had not firſt reſpected Chriſt incarnate, they could never have expected any temporal deliverance by that promiſe of deliverance, firſt laid down; But in this way they might, and ſo may we.—You will ſay what's this to us? they looked for Chriſt to come in the fleſh, but now he is come, and that time and deſign is gone and paſt many a year ſince; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no, the time is gone, but the deſign is not; Chriſt remains God in the fleſh to this very day; he came not as once to manifeſt himſelf in fleſh, to ſatisfie Gods juſtice in the fleſh for ſin, and ſo to lay it down again; that fleſh remains, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; nor is it without uſe, for all the ſpirit and life which the Saints now have, or which the Saints ſhall have unto the end of the World, it is to be conveyed through that fleſh, yea the Spirit it ſelf dwells in it, and is conveyed through it, and therefore if they had ſo much Goſpel-Spirit in the time of the Old Teſtament (which indeed was rare) how much more ſhould we go to Chriſt as God in the fleſh, and look upon it as a ſtanding Ordinance, and believe perfectly on it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith muſt go and lye at the feet of Chriſt; faith muſt fix and faſten it ſelf on this God in our fleſh: ſome go to Chriſt, and <hi>look on Jeſus</hi> with looſe and tranſient glances, they bring in but flaſhy, ſecondary, ordinary actings of faith, they have but courſe and common apprehenſions of Jeſus Chriſt. Oh but we ſhould come to Chriſt with ſolemn ſerious ſpirits; we ſhould <hi>look on Jeſus</hi> piercingly, till we ſee him as God is in him, and as ſuch a perſon thus and thus qualified from Heaven; we ſhould labour to apprehend what is the riches of this glorious myſtery of Chriſt's <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> we ſhould dive into the depths of his glorious actings; we ſhould ſtudy this myſtery above all other ſtudies; nothing is ſo pleaſant, and nothing is more deep; that one perſon ſhould be God and Man, that God ſhould be man in our nature, and yet not aſſume the perſon of a man; that bleſſedneſs ſhould be made a curſe, that Heaven ſhould be let down into Hell, that the God of the world would ſhut himſelf up (as it were) in a body; that the inviſible God ſhould be made viſible to ſenſe; that all things ſhould become nothing, and make it ſelf of no reputation; that God ſhould make our nature, which had ſinned againſt him, to be the great Ordinance of Reconciling us unto himſelf, that God ſhould take our fleſh, and dwell in it with all his fulneſs, and make that fleſh more Glorious than the Angels, and advance that fleſh into one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with himſelf, and through that fleſh open all his councels and rich diſcoveries of love and free-grace unto the Sons of men; that this Man-God, God-Man ſhould be our Saviour, Redeemer, Reconciler, Father, Friend; Oh what myſteries are theſe! no wonder if when Chriſt was born,<note place="margin">John 1.14.</note> the Apoſtle cryes, <hi>we ſaw his glory, as of the only begotten Son of God;</hi> noting out, that at firſt ſight of him, ſo much glory ſparkled from him as could appear from none, but a God walking up and down the world. O my ſoul, let not ſuch a treaſury be unlookt into; ſet faith on work with a redoubled ſtrength; ſurely we live not like men under this great deſign, if our eye of faith be not firmly and ſtedfaſtly ſet on this. O that we were but inſighted into theſe glories! that we were but acquainted with theſe lively diſcoveries?<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> how bleſſedly might we <hi>live by the Faith of the Son of God who loved us, and gave himſelf for us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:94897:84"/>4. Faith muſt look principally to the end and meaning of Chriſt as God coming in the Fleſh. Now what was the deſign and meaning of Chriſt in this? The Apoſtle anſwers, Rom. 8.3.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> 
                     <hi>God ſent his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, to condemn ſin in the Fleſh, (i.e.)</hi> God the Father ſent into the World his eternal and only begotten Son, whom in his eternal counſel he had deſigned to the Office of a Mediator, to take away or aboliſh in the firſt place Original Sin. Mark theſe two words, <hi>he condemned Sin in the Fleſh;</hi> the firſt word <hi>condemned</hi>] is by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> put for that which follows Condemnation, namely for the aboliſhing of ſin; as condemned perſons uſed to be cut off, and to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the World, that they may be no more; ſo Chriſt hath condemned or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this Sin. For the ſecond word, <hi>in the Fleſh</hi>] is meant that Humane Nature which Chriſt aſſumed: he aboliſhed ſin altogether in his own nature; and that Fleſh of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly holy, and the holineſs of it being imputed unto us, it takes away our guilt in reſpect of the impureneſs of our Nature alſo. Some may object, if this were ſo, then were we without Original ſin? I anſwer, the Fleſh or the Nature which Chriſt took upon him, was altogether without ſin; and by imputation of it we are in proportion freed from ſin; Chriſt had not the leaſt ſpot of Original ſin; and if we are Chriſts, then is this ſin in ſome meaſure aboliſhed and taken out of our hearts. But howſoever the filth of this ſin may remain in part, yet the guilt is removed: in this reſpect the purity of Chriſts Humane Nature is no leſs reckoned to us for the curing of our defiled Nature, than the ſufferings of Chriſt are reckoned to us, for the remiſſion of our actual Sins. O my Soul, look to this end of Chriſt as God in the Fleſh; if thou conſider him as made Fleſh and Blood, and laid in a Manger, think withal, that his meaning was to condemn ſin in our Fleſh; there flows from the Holineſs of Chriſts Nature ſuch a power, as countermands the power of our Original ſin, and acquits and diſcharges from the condemnation of the ſame Sin: not only the Death, and Life, but alſo the Conception and Birth of Chriſt hath its influence into our Juſtification. Oh the ſweet that a lively Faith may draw from this Head!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Encouragements to bring on Souls to believe on Chriſt Incarnate, we may draw—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the excellency of this Object. This very Incarnation of Chriſt is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all other actings of God for us; it is the very Hinge or Pole on which all turn; it is the Cabinet wherein all the Deſigns of God do lie; Election, Redemption, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, Glorification, are all wrapt up in it; it is the higheſt pitch of the Declaration of Gods Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power and Glory; Oh what a ſweet Object of Faith is this! I know there are ſome other things in in Chriſt which are moſt proper for ſome Acts of Faith; as Chriſt dying is moſt proper for the pardon of actual ſin; and Chriſt riſing from the dead is moſt proper for the evidencing of our Juſtification; but the ſtrongeſt pureſt Acts of Faith are thoſe which take in Chriſt as ſuch a Perſon, laid out in all this Glory. Chriſts Incarnation is more general than Chriſts Paſſion, or Chriſts Reſurrection, and (as ſome would have it) includes all; Chriſts Incarnation holds forth in ſome ſort Chriſt in his fulneſs, and ſo it is the full and compleat ſubject of our Faith; or if it be only more comprehenſive, why then it requires more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Acts of Faith, and by conſequence we have more enjoyments of Chriſt this way, than any other way: Come poor Soul, I feel, I feel thy eyes are running to and fro the World, to find comforts and happineſs on Earth: O come, caſt thy eyes back, and ſee Heaven and Earth in one Object! look fixedly on Chriſt Incarnate! there is more in this, than in all the variety of this World, or of that World to come. Here is an Object of Faith, and Love, and Joy, and Delight; here is a <hi>Compendium</hi> of all Glories; here is one for a heart to be taken with to all Eternity. O lay thy mouth to this Fountain; <hi>ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breſts of his Conſolation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 66.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Milk out and be delighted with the brightneſs of his Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the ſutableneſs of this Object. Chriſt Incarnate is moſt ſutable for our Faith to act upon. We are indeed to believe on God; but God eſſentially is the utmoſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith; we cannot come to God, but in and through Chriſt; alas, God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and therefore we cannot find ground immediately to go to God; hence you heard that <hi>Faith muſt directly go to Chriſt as God in our Fleſh.</hi> O the infinite condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God in Chriſt! God takes up our Nature, and joins it to himſelf as one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and layes out that before our Faith; ſo that here is God, and God ſuited to the particular ſtate and condition of the ſinner. Oh now with what boldneſs may our ſouls draw nigh to God? Why art thou ſtrange poor ſoul? Why ſtandeſt thou afar off, as if it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94897:85"/> were death to draw nigh? Of whom art thou affraid? Is God come down amongſt men, and canſt thou not ſee him, leſt thou die and periſh? Oh look once more, and be not diſcouraged! See, God is not come down in fire, God is not deſcended in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Juſtice and everlaſting burnings; No, no, he is cloathed with the Garments of Fleſh, he ſweetly deſires to converſe with thee after thine own form; he is come down to beſeech thee, to ſee with thine own eyes thy eternal happineſs. <hi>q. d. Come poor Soul, come, put in thy hands, and feel my heart how it beats in love towards thee.</hi> O the wonder of Heaven! it is the cry of ſome poor ſouls. <hi>Oh that I might ſee God!</hi> loe here God is come down in the likeneſs of man, he walks in our own ſhape amongſt us; it is the cry oft others, <hi>O that I might have my heart united to God!</hi> Why he is come down on this very purpoſe, and hath united our nature unto himſelf. Surely God hath left all the World without excuſe: Oh that ever there ſhould be an heart of unbelief, after theſe ſenſible demonſtrations of Divine Glory and Love? Why ſoul, wilt thou now ſtand off? Tell me, what wouldſt thou have God do more? Can he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf in a more taking, alluring, ſutable way to thy condition? Is there any thing below fleſh wherein the great God can humble himſelf for thy good? Come, think of another, and a better way, or elſe for ever believe. Methinks it is ſad to ſee Believers ſhy in their approaches to God, or doubtful of their acceptance with God, when God himſelf ſtoops firſt, and is ſo in love with our acquaintance, that he will be of the ſome nature that we are. O let not ſuch a Rock of ſtrength be ſlighted, but every day entertain ſweet and precious thoughts of Chriſt being incarnate; enure thy heart to a way of believing on this Jeſus, as he carries on the great Work of thy Slavation at his firſt Coming or Incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the Goſpel-tenders and offers of this bleſſed Object to our Souls. As Chriſt is come in our natue to ſatisfie, ſo he comes in the Goſpel freely and fully to offer thee terms of Love; therein are ſet out the moſt rich and alluring expreſſions that poſſibly can be; therein is ſet out that this <hi>Incarnation of Chriſt</hi> was Gods own acting, out of his own Love and Grace, and Glory; therein is ſet out the Birth, and Life, and Death of Chriſt; and this he could not do, but he muſt be Incarnate: God takes our Fleſh, and he uſeth that as an Organ, or Inſtrument whereby to Act; he was Fleſh to ſuffer, as he was Spirit to ſatisfie for our ſins. Methinks I might challenge Unbelief, and bid it come forth; let it appear if it dare before this Conſideration: What is not God Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate enough to ſatisfie thy Conſcience? Come nigh poor Soul! hear the Voice of Chriſt inviting,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary, and heavy laden with Sin;</hi> and O let theſe rich and glorious openings of the heart of Chriſt overcome thy heart: Suppoſe the caſe thus; what if God ſhould have done no more than this? Had he only looked down from Heaven, and hearing ſinners cry out, <hi>O wo, wo unto us for ever! we have broke Gods Law, incurr'd the penalty, damned our own ſouls; O who ſhould deliver us? Who will ſave us from the Wrath to Come? Who will keep us out of Hell, our deſerved Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where the fury of the great Judge burns in a fiery Brimſtone, and his revenge boyls in a fiery Torrent limitleſs and unquenchable.</hi> In this caſe, if God hearing ſinners thus crying out; had he, I ſay, only looked down and told them in ſweet Language, <hi>Poor ſouls, I will pardon your Sins by my own Prerogative, I made the Law, and I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with it; fear not, I have the Keyes of Life and Death, and upon my word you ſhall not periſh;</hi> What ſoul would not have been raiſed up even from the bottom of Hell at this very voice? I know a poor ſoul would have ſcrupled at this, and have ſaid, <hi>What then ſhould become of infinite Juſtice? ſhall that be diſhonoured to ſave my Soul?</hi> This would have been a ſcruple indeed, eſpecially conſidering that great controverſie (as we have heard) of <hi>Mercy and Truth, and Righteouſneſs and Peace:</hi> but to remove all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, God hath not only ſpoken from Heaven by himſelf, but he himſelf is come down from Heaven to Earth to ſpeak unto us: O ſee this Miracle of Mercy! God is come down in Fleſh, he is come as a price; he himſelf will pay himſelf according to all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Juſtice and Righteouſneſs before our eyes; and all this done, now he offers and tenders himſelf unto thy ſoul. Oh my ſoul, why ſhouldeſt thou fear to caſt thy ſelf upon thy God? I know thy Objection of vileneſs; notwithſtanding all thy vileneſs, God himſelf offers himſelf to lead thee by the hand; and to remove all doubts, God himſelf hath put a price ſufficient in the hands of Juſtice to ſtop her Mouth: or if yet thou feareſt to come to God, why come then to thy own Fleſh, go to Chriſt, as having thy own nature; it is he that calls thee: How? Go to Fleſh? Go to thy own Nature? What can be ſaid more to draw on thy trembling heart? If God himſelf,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94897:85"/> and God ſo fitted and qualified (as I may ſay) will not allure, muſt not men die and periſh in unbelief? What, O my ſoul! (give me leave to chide thee) Is God come down ſo low to thee? and doſt thou now ſtand queſtioning whether thou ſhouldſt go, or come to him? What is this but to ſay, all that God is, or does, or ſayes, is too little to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me into Faith? I cannot tell, but one would think that unbelief ſhould be ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, quite ſlain upon this conſideration; all this, O my ſoul, thou heareſt in the Goſpel; there is Chriſt incarnate ſet forth to the life; there is Chriſt ſuing thy Loves, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf as thy beloved in thy own naure; there it is written that God is come down in fleſh, with an Olive-branch of eternal peace in his hand, and bids you all be witneſs, he is not come to deſtroy, but to ſave. Oh that this encouragement might be of force to improve Chriſts glorious deſign to the ſupplying of all thy wants, and to the making up of all thy loſſes! believe, Oh believe thy part in Chriſt incarnate!</p>

                     <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> Of loving Jeſus in that reſpect.</head>
                  <p>LEt us <hi>love Jeſus,</hi> as carrying on the great work of our Salvation at his firſt Coming or Incarnation. Now what is <hi>Love</hi> but an expanſion or egreſs of the heart and ſpirits to the Object loved; or to the Object whereby it is drawn or attracted? Mark O my ſoul, whatſoever hath an attractive power, it is in that reſpect an Object, or general cauſe of Love; and canſt thou poſſibly light on any Object more attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive than the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt? If Love be the Load-ſtone of Love, what an attractive is this before thee? methinks the very ſight of Chriſt incarnate is enough to raviſh thee with the apprehenſion of his infinite goodneſs: ſee how he calls out, or (as it were) draws out the ſoul to Union, Viſion, and Participation of his Glory! O come, and yield up thy ſelf unto him; give him thy ſelf, and conform all thy Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Actions to his Will: O love him, not with a divided, but with all thy heart.</p>
                  <p>But to excite this Love, I ſhall only propound the Object, which will be Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough. Love cauſeth Love; now as Gods firſt Love to man was in making man like himſelf; ſo his ſecond great Love was in making himſelf like to man; ſtay then a while upon this Love; for (I take it) this is the greater Love of the two: Nay, if I muſt ſpeak freely, I believe this was the fulleſt viſible demonſtration of Gods Love that ever was: The Evangeliſt expreſſeth it thus, <hi>God ſo loved the World,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son;</hi> he gave him to be incarnate, to be made fleſh, and to ſuffer Death; but the extention of his Love lies in that expreſſion, <hi>he ſo loved</hi>] So! how? Why, ſo fully, ſo fatherly, ſo freely, as no Tongue can tell, no heart can think: In this Love God did not only let out a mercy, give out a bare grace in ſelf, but he took our nature upon him. It is uſually ſaid, that it is a greater love of God to ſave a ſoul, than to make a World; and I think it was a greater Love of God to take our nature, than ſimply to ſave our ſouls; for a King to diſpenſe with the Law, and by his own prerogative to ſave a Murderer from the Gallows, is not ſuch an Act of Love and Mercy as to take the Murderers Cloaths, and to wear them as their Richeſt Livery? Why, God in taking our nature hath done thus, and more than thus; he would not ſave us by his meer Prerogative; but he takes our Cloaths, our Fleſh, and in that Fleſh he perſonates us, and in that Fleſh he will die for us, that we might not die, but live through him for evermore. Surely this was Love, that God will be no more God (as it were) ſimply, but he will take up another nature, rather than the brightneſs of his Glory ſhall undo our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>It will not be amiſs (whil'ſt I am endeavouring to draw a Line of Gods love in Chriſt, from firſt to laſt in ſaving Souls) that here we look back a little, and ſummarily contract the paſſages of Love from that eternity before all Worlds, unto this preſent. 1. God had an eternal deſign to diſcover his infinite love to ſome beſides himſelf; O the wonder of this! was there any need or neceſſity of ſuch a diſcovery? Though God was one,<note place="margin">Deus unus licet ſolus non ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> and in that reſpect alone (as we may imagine) yet God was not ſolitary; in that eternity within his own proper eſſence or ſubſtance, there were three Divine Perſons, and betwixt them there was a bleſſed Communication of Love; Chriſt on Earth could ſay, <hi>I am not alone, becauſe the Father is with me:</hi> and then before the Earth was, might the Father ſay, <hi>I am not alone, for the Son is with me;</hi> and the Son might ſay, <hi>I am not alone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 16.32.</note>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:94897:86"/> 
                     <hi>for the Father is with me;</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt might ſay, <hi>I am not alone, for both the Father and the Son are with me;</hi> though in that eternity there was no Creature to whom theſe three Perſons ſhould communicate their Love; yet was there a glorious communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and breaking out of Love from one to another; before there was a World, the Father,<note place="margin">John 17.15.</note> Son, and Holy Ghoſt did infinitely glorifie themſelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. Surely they loved one another, and they rejoyced in the fruition of one another, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30.<note place="margin">Prov. 8.30.</note> What need then was there of the diſcovery of Gods love to any one beſides himſelf? O my ſoul, I know no neceſſity for it, only thus was the pleaſure of God; <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight:</hi> ſuch was the love of God, that it would not contain it ſelf within that infinite Ocean of himſelf, but it would needs have Rivers and Channels, into which it might run and overflow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God in proſecution of his deſign, creates a World of Creatures; ſome rational, and only capable of Love; others irrational, and ſerviceable to that one Creature, which he makes the top of the whole Creation; then it was that he ſet up one man <hi>Adam,</hi> as a common perſon, to repreſent the reſt; to him he gives abundance of glorious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and him he ſets over all the work of his hands, as if he were the very Darling of Love; if we ſhould view the excellency of this Creature either in the outward, or the inner man, who would not wonder? his body had its excellency, which made the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſay, <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made,—and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt part of the Earth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.14, 15.</note> It is a ſpeech borrowed from thoſe who work Arras-work; the body of man is a piece of curious Tapeſtry, or Arras-work, conſiſting of Skin, Bones, Muſcles, Sinews, and the like; what a goodly thing the body of man was before the Fall, may be gueſſed by the excellent gifts found in the bodies of ſome men ſince the Fall; as the Complection of <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.12. the ſwiftneſs of <hi>Hazael,</hi> 2 Sam. 2.18. the beauty of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.25. If all theſe were but joyned in one, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they were in <hi>Adam,</hi> what a rare Body would ſuch a one be? but what was this body in compariſon of that ſoul? the ſoul was it, that was eſpecially made after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God; the ſoul was it, that was tempered in the ſame Mortar with the Heavenly Spirits; the ſoul was Gods ſparkle, a beam of his divine Glory, a ray, or emanation of God himſelf; as man was the principal part of the Creation, ſo the Soul was the principal part of man: here was it that Gods Love and Glory were centred for the time; here was it that Gods love ſet and fixt it ſelf in a ſpecial man, whence flowed that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of God with <hi>Adam,</hi> and that familiarity of <hi>Adam</hi> with God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Within a while, this man, the object of Gods Love, fell away from God, and as he fell, ſo all that were in him; even the whole World fell together with him; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Gods Face was hid; not a ſight of him but in flaming fire, ready to ſeize on the Sons of Men. And yet Gods Love would not thus leave the Object; he had yet a further reach of Love, and out of this dark Cloud he lets fall ſome glimpſes of another diſcovery: Theſe glimpſes were ſweet: but alas, they were ſo dark that very few could ſpell them, or make any ſenſe, or comfortable application of them: but by degrees God hints it out more; he points it out with the Finger by Types and Shadows, he makes ſome models of it in outward Ceremonies, and yet ſo hid and dark, that in four thouſand years, men were but gueſſing, and hoping through promiſes, for a manifeſtation of Gods Love; this is the meaning of the Apoſtle, who tells us of <hi>the Myſtery that was hid from Ages, and from Generations, but now is made manifeſt to his Saints:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1.26.</note> This Love of God was hid in the breaſt of God from the Sons of Men for an Age, ſo that they knew not what to make of this great Deſign: I ſpeak of the generality of men; for in reſpect of ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as to <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the Patriarchs, you have heard the Lord made his Loves clear to them in a Covenant-Way; and ſtill the nearer to Chriſt, the clearer and clearer was the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. At laſt God fully opens himſelf; in the fulneſs of time God takes the fleſh of thoſe poor ſinners which he had ſo loved, and joins it to himſelf, and calls it Chriſt, a Saviour: O! now was it that God deſcended, and lay in the Womb of a Virgin; now was it that he is born as we are born; now was it that he joined our Fleſh ſo nigh to himſelf, as that there is a Communication of properties betwixt them both, that being attributed to God which is proper to Fleſh, as to be born, to ſuffer; and that being attributed to fleſh which is proper to God, as to create, to redeem: who can chuſe but wonder when he thinks of this phraſe, that a piece of Fleſh ſhould be called
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94897:86"/> God? and that God ſhould be made fleſh and dwell amongſt us? that fleſh ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely provoke God, and yet God in the ſame fleſh ſhould be infinitely pleaſed? that God ſhould veile himſelf and darken his Glory with our fleſh, and yet unveile at the ſame time the deepeſt and darkeſt of his deſigns in a comfortable way to our ſouls? O my ſoul, how ſhouldſt thou contain thy ſelf within thy ſelf? how ſhouldſt thou but leap out of thy ſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) as one that is loſt in the admiration of this Love? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God never manifeſted himſelf in ſuch a ſtrain of Love as this before; herein was love manifeſted and commended indeed, that God would come down in our nature to us. One obſerves ſweetly, that <hi>God did ſo love the very Nature of his Elect, that though for the preſent he had them not all with him in Heaven, yet he muſt have their Picture in his Son to ſee them in, and love them in;</hi> in this reſpect I may call Chriſt incarnate, a Statue and Monument of Gods own infinite Love unto his Elect for ever.</p>
                  <p>Well, hitherto we have followed the paſſages of his Love; and now we ſee it in the Spring, or at full Sea; If any thing will beget our love to God, ſurely Chriſt incarnate will do it: Come then, O my Soul, I cannot but call on thee to love thy Jeſus; and to provoke thy Love, O fix thy eye on this lovely Object; come, put thy Candle to this Flame; what? doth not thy heart yet burn within thee? doſt thou not at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to warm? why, draw yet a little nearer; conſider, what an heart of Love is in this Deſign: God is in thy own nature, to take upon him all the miſeries of thy Nature; mark it well, this is none other than Gods heart leaping out of it ſelf into our boſoms; <hi>q. d. Poor ſouls, I cannot keep from you, I love your very Nature; I will be nothing, ſo you may be ſomething; my Glory ſhall not hinder me, but I will vail it rather than it ſhall hurt you; ſo I may but ſhew my ſelf kind and tender unto you, and ſo I may but have Communion with you, and you with me, I care not if I become one with you, and live with you in your very fleſh.</hi> Oh my heart, art thou yet cold in thy Loves to Jeſus Chriſt? canſt thou love him but a little, who hath loved thee ſo much? how ſhould I then but complain of thee to Chriſt? and for thy ſake beg hard of God, <hi>Oh thou ſweet</hi> Jeſus, <hi>that cloatheſt thy ſelf with the Clouds as with a garment, and as now thou cloatheſt thy ſelf with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man: O thou that wouldeſt inflame my Spirit with a Love of thee, that nothing but thy ſelf might be dear unto me, becauſe it ſo pleaſed thee to vilifie thy ſelf, thine own ſelf for my ſake.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. God is come down in fleſh; he hath laid aſide, as it were, his own Glory, whileſt he converſeth with thee; when God manifeſted himſelf, as on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he came down in Thunder and Lightning; and if now he had appeared in Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if now he had been guarded with an innumerable Company of Angels, all having their Swords of vengeance and juſtice drawn, well might poor ſouls have trembled, and have run into corners; for who could ever be able to endure his coming in this way? but lo poor Soul, God is come down in fleſh, he hath made his appearance as a man, as one of us, and there is not in this regard the leaſt diſtance betwixt him and us. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is fewel for joy to feed upon: O why ſhould God come down ſo ſutably, ſo lowly, as in our nature, if he would have thy poor ſoul to be afraid of him? doth not this very deſign intend conſolation to thy ſoul? O gather up thy Spirit, anoint thy heart with the Oyl of gladneſs; ſee God himſelf is come down in fleſh to live amongſt us, he profeſſeth he will have no other life but amongſt the Sons of men; ſee what a ſweet way of familiarity and entercourſe is made betwixt God and us, now he is come down in humane frailty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath took on him our Nature as a vaſt pipe to his Godhead, that it may flow out in all manner of ſweetneſs upon our hearts; if God had come down in fleſh, only to have been ſeen of us,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.12.</note> it had been a wonderful condeſcention, and a great mercy: <hi>if I have found favour in thy eyes</hi> (ſaid <hi>Moſes) ſhew me thy way that I may know thee;</hi> but to come down in fleſh, and to come down in fleſh, not only to be ſeen, but to diſpatch the great buſineſs of our ſouls Salvation, here's comfort indeed: with what joy ſhould we draw water out of this well of ſalvation? Surely the great reaſon of the ſhallowneſs of our Comforts, ſhortneſs of our Hopes, the faintneſs of our ſpirits, the lowneſs of our Graces, is from the not knowing, or the not heeding of this particular; Chriſt in fleſh ſtands not for a Cypher, but it is an Organ of life and grace unto us; it is a fountain of comfort that can never run dry. In this fleſh there is laid in on purpoſe ſuch a fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that of his fulneſs we might receive in our meaſure grace for grace. O my ſoul, thou art daily buſy in eying this and that; but above all, know that all the fulneſs God lies in Chriſt incarnate, to be emptied upon thee: this was the meaning of Chriſt taking on him fleſh, that through his fleſh he might convey to thee whatſoever is in himſelf as God. As for inſtance, God in himſelf is Good, and Gracious, and Powerful, and All-ſufficient, and Merciful, and what not? Now by his being in fleſh, he ſuites all this, and conveyes all this to thee; obſerve this for thy eternal comfort, God in and through the fleſh makes all his Attributes and Glory ſerviceable to thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God in our Nature hath laid out the Model and Draught of what he will do
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94897:87"/> unto all his Saints for ever; humane nature was never ſo advanced before; what? to be glorified above the Angels? to be united in a Perſonal union with the ſecond perſon of the Godhead? ſurely hence may be expected great matters; here's a fair ſtep for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Perſons up to the enjoyment of God; if God be come down in the likeneſs of man, why, then he will bring us up into the likeneſs of God; look what was done to our nature in Chriſt, the very ſame (as far as we are capable) ſhall be done to our perſons in Heaven. Think of it, O my ſoul, why hath God made fleſh ſo glorious, but to ſhew that he will by that make thee glorious alſo? Chriſt is the great Epitome of all the deſigns of God, ſo that in him thou mayeſt ſee what thou art deſigned unto, and how high and rich thou ſhalt be in the other world. <hi>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 3.2.</note>

                     <hi>he will change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his Glorious body.</hi> Oh conſider what a frame of eternal comfort may we raiſe up from this ground of Chriſt incarnate, God in the fleſh?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God in the fleſh is the firſt opening of his eternal plot to do us good; <hi>the Seed of the woman</hi> was the firſt word of comfort that ever was heard in the world after man was fallen; the Plot was of old, but the execution was not till after the Creation, and then was a dim diſcovery of it, even in the beginning of time, though no clear manifeſtation till the fulneſs of time. Well, take it as we pleaſe, whether in the beginning of time, or in the fulneſs of time; whether in the promiſe, or in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, this diſcovering of Chriſt incarnate is the firſt opening of all Gods heart and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto the Sons of men; and from this we may raiſe a world of comfort; for if God in the execution of his Decrees, begins ſo gloriouſly, how will he end? if God be ſo full of love, as to come down in fleſh now in this world, Oh what matter of hope is laid up before us, of what God will be to us in that world to come? if the Glory of God be let out to our ſouls ſo fully at firſt, what Glorious openings of all the Glory of God will be let out to our ſouls at laſt? Chriſtians! what do you think will God do with us, or bring us unto, when we ſhall be with him in heaven? you ſee now he is manifeſted in fleſh, and he hath laid out a world of Glory in that: but the Apoſtle tells us of another manifeſtation, for we <hi>ſhall ſee him as he is;</hi> he ſhall at laſt be manifeſt in himſelf;<note place="margin">1 John 3.2.</note> 
                     <hi>now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then we ſhall know even as alſo we are known.</hi> To what an height of knowledg or manifeſtation this doth ariſe, I am now to ſeek, and ſo I muſt be whilſt I am on this ſide Heaven; but this I believe, the manifeſtation of God and Chriſt is more in Heaven, than is, or ever hath been, or ever ſhall be upon earth; <hi>thine eyes ſhall ſee the King in his Beauty,</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. LEt us <hi>call on Jeſus,</hi> or on God the Father in and through <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Now this <hi>calling on Jeſus</hi> contains Prayer and Praiſe. 1. We muſt pray that all theſe tranſactions of Jeſus at his firſt coming or incarnation may be ours; and is not here encouragement for our Prayers? If we obſerve it, this very point of Chriſts Incarnation opens a door of rich entrance into the preſence of God; we may call it a bleſſed Portal into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">b. 10. 20.</note> not of Iron, or Braſs, but of our own fleſh; this is that <hi>new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us, through the Vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh;</hi> with what boldneſs and freeneſs may we now enter into the Holieſt, and draw near unto the Throne of Grace? why, Chriſt is incarnate, God is come down in the fleſh; though his Deity may confound us (if we ſhould immediately and ſolely apply our ſelves unto it) yet his humanity comforts our faint and feeble ſouls, God in his humility animates our ſouls to come unto him, and to ſeek of him whatſoever is needful for us. Go then to Chriſt; away, away O my ſoul, to Jeſus, or to God the Father, in and through Jeſus; and O deſire that the effect, the fruit, the benefit of his Conception, Birth, and of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful union of the two natures of Chriſt may be all thine. What? doſt thou hope in Jeſus, and believe thy part in this Incarnation of Chriſt? why then pray in hope, and pray in Faith; what is prayer, but the ſtream and river of Faith, an iſſue of the deſire of that which I joyfully believe?<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou, O Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> God <hi>of Iſrael, haſt revealed to thy Servant, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe, therefore hath thy ſervant found in his heart, to pray this Prayer unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt praiſe. This was the ſpecial duty practiſed by all Saints and Angels at Chriſts Birth,<note place="margin">Luke 1.46. Luke 1.68.</note>

O my ſoul, do thou endeavour to keep conſort with thoſe many Angels: <hi>O ſing Praiſes, ſing Praiſes unto God, ſing Praiſes.</hi> Never was like caſe ſince the firſt Creation: never was the wiſdom, truth, juſtice, mercy, and goodneſs of God ſo manifeſt before; I ſhall never forget that laſt ſpeech of a dying Saint upon the ſtage, <hi>Bleſſed be God for Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> O my ſoul, living and dying let this be thought on: What?

                  <p n="9">9. LEt us <hi>conform to Jeſus</hi> in reference to this great tranſaction of his Incarnation. <hi>Looking to Jeſus</hi> contains this, and is the cauſe of this; the ſight of God will make us like to God; and the ſight of Chriſt will make us like to Chriſt; for as a Looking-Glaſs cannot be expoſed to the Sun, but it will ſhine like the ſame; ſo God receives none to contemplate his face, but he transforms them into his own likeneſs by the irradiation
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94897:88"/> of his light; and Chriſt hath none that dive into theſe depths of his glorious and bleſſed Incarnation, but they carry along with them ſweet impreſſions of an abiding and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming nature. Come then, let us once more <hi>look on Jeſus</hi> in his Incarnation, that we may conform, and be like to Jeſus in <hi>that reſpect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But wherein lies this conformity or likeneſs to Jeſus? I anſwer, in theſe and the like particulars.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt was conceived in <hi>Mary</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt; ſo muſt Chriſt be conceived in us by the ſame holy Ghoſt. To this purpoſe is the ſeed of the Word caſt in, and principles of Grace are by the Holy Ghoſt infuſed; <hi>he hath begotten us by the Word,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18.<note place="margin">James 1.18.</note> How Mean, Contemptible, or Impotent Men may eſteem it, yet God hath appointed no other means to convey ſupernatural life, but after this manner: <hi>Where no Viſion is, the People periſh:</hi> where no preaching is, there is a worſe judgment than that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when there was one dead in every Family. By the Word and Spirit the Seeds of all Grace are ſown in the heart at once, and the heart cloſing with it, immediatly Chriſt is conceived in the heart.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this ſpiritual Conception or Reception of Chriſt in us, there is a great queſtion, Whether it be poſſible for any man to diſcern how it is wrought? But for the Negative are theſe Texts, <hi>Our Life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. and <hi>the Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or whither it goeth,</hi> Joh. 3.8. It is a wonderful, hidden and ſecret Conception. The holy Ghoſt ſets out that ſtate of unregeneracy, in which Chriſt finds us, by the name of <hi>Death,</hi> Eph. 2.1. So that it muſt needs be as impoſſible for us to diſcover how it is wrought, as it is impoſſible for one to know how he receives his own life. Some ſay, the firſt act of infuſing or receiving Chriſt or Grace (they are all one) is wrought in an inſtant, and not by degrees; and therefore it is impoſſible to diſcern the manner: And yet we grant that we may diſcern both the preparations to Grace, and the firſt operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grace. 1. The preparations to Grace are diſcernable; ſuch are thoſe terrours and ſpiritual agonies, which are often before the work of Regeneration; they may be reſembled to the heating of metals before they melt, and are caſt into the Mold to be faſhioned; now by the help of Natural Reaſon one may diſcern theſe. 2. Much more may the firſt Motion and Operations of Grace be diſcerned by one truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, becauſe that in them his Spirit works together with the Spirit of Chriſt; ſuch are ſorrow for ſin as ſin, and ſeek rightly for comfort, an hungring deſire after Chriſt and his Merits; neither do I think it impoſſible for a regenerate man to feel the very firſt illapſe of the Spirit into the Soul; for it may bring that ſenſe with it ſelf, as to be eaſily diſcerned, although it doth not alwayes ſee, nor perhaps uſually ſee; it is true that the giving of Spiritual Life, and the giving of the ſenſe of it, are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct acts of the Spirit; yet who can deny, but that both theſe acts may go together; though alwayes they do not go together? Howſoever it is, yet even in ſuch Perſons as in the inſtant of Regeneration may feel themſelves in a regenerate eſtate: this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſtands firm, <hi>viz. They may know what is wrought in them, but how it is wrought, they cannot know, nor underſtand;</hi> we feel the Wind, and perceive it in the motions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations thereof; but the Originals of it we are not able exactly to deſcribe: ſome think the beginnings of Winds are from the flux of the Air, others from the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth; but there is no certainty: ſo it is in the manner of this Conception, or paſſive Reception of Chriſt and Grace into our hearts; we know not how it is wrought, but it nearly concerns us to know that it is wrought; look we to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, that as Chriſt was conceived in <hi>Mary</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt; ſo, that Chriſt be conceived in us, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, by the ſame Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt was ſanctified in the Virgins Womb; ſo muſt we be ſanctified in our ſelves, following the Commandment of God; <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy:</hi> Souls regenerate muſt be ſanctified; <hi>Every man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that hath this hope in him,</hi>

To this purpoſe is that of the Apoſtle; <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that ye preſent your Bodyes a living Sacrifice, Holy, acceptable unto God.</hi>

O that we would <hi>look to Jeſus,</hi> and be like unto Jeſus in this thing! if there be any Honour, any Happineſs, any Excellency, it is in this, even in this; we are not fit for any holy duty, or any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious approach unto God without ſanctification;<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.5.</note>

                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt the Son of God, was yet the Son of Man; there was yet in him a duplicity of Natures really diſtinguiſhed; and in this reſpect, the greateſt Majeſty, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt humility that ever was, are found in Chriſt; ſo we, though ſons of God, muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our ſelves to be but ſons of men; our priviledges are not ſo high, but our poor conditions, frailties, infirmities, ſins, may make us low: who was higher than the Son of God? and who was lower than the ſon of man? as he is God, he is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his Father; as he is man, he is in the Womb of his Mother; as he is God, his Throne is in Heaven; and he fills all things by his emmenſity; as he is man, he is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed in a cradle, I mean a Manger, a moſt uneaſy Cradle ſure; as he is God, he is cloathed in a robe of Glory; as he is man, he is wrapped in a few courſe ſwadling bands; as he is God, he is encircled with millions of bright Angels; as he man, he is in company of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Beaſts; as he is God, he is the eternal Word of the Father, all-ſufficient, and without need; as he is man, he ſubmits himſelf to a condition imperfect, inglorious, indigent, and neceſſitous: well, <hi>let this mind be in you, which was alſo in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.5, 6, 7, 8.</note>

But herein if we reſemble <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whether in his union with the Father, or in his union of the two natures in one Perſon of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; if by looking on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we come to this likeneſs, to be one with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Oh what a priviledg is this! had we not good warrant for ſo high a challeng, it could be no leſs than a Blaſphemous arrogance to lay claim to the Royal blood of Heaven; but the Lord is pleaſed to dignifie a poor worm, that every believer may truly ſay, <hi>I am one with Jeſus Chriſt, and Jeſus Chriſt is one with me.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. When Chriſt was born, there was a diſcovery of many of the Glorious attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God; then <hi>Mercy and Truth met together, and righteouſneſs and peace kiſſed each

So when this New Birth is, we muſt look upon it as a glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of thoſe lovely Attributes. As, 1. Of his Mercy, Goodneſs, Love; how often is this called his Grace, and the riches of his Grace? Chriſtians! you that know what the New Birth means, do you not ſay, <hi>The Goodneſs of God appears in this?</hi> ſurely it was Gods Goodneſs to make a World, but this is the riches of his Goodneſs to create a New Heart in you; when Man by his ſin was fallen, he might have been thrown away as refuſe, fit fuel only, for everlaſting flames; it might have been with mankind as it was with Devils, in their deluge God did not provide an Ark to ſave ſo many as eight perſons, not one Angel that fell was the Object of Gods Grace; And that God ſhould paſs by all thoſe Angels, and many thouſands of the Sons Men, and yet that he ſhould look upon you in your Blood, and bid you Live: O the goodneſs of God!</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. As of the Goodneſs and Power of God, ſo in this New Birth there's a diſcovery of the Wiſdom of God. I might inſtance in many particulars; As, 1. In that the regenerate are moſt-what of the meaneſt and contemptibleſt perſons; <hi>not many wiſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.27.</note> 
                     <hi>not many noble,</hi> &amp;c. 2. In that many times God takes the worſt Weeds and makes them the ſweeteſt Flowers; thus <hi>Paul, Zacheus,</hi> the Publicans, and Harlots. 3. In that the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are of the feweſt, and leaſt number; <hi>many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> 4. In that God chooſeth ſuch a time to be his time of love, wherein he uſually diſcovers many concurrences of ſtrange love meeting together; read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4, 5, 6, 8, 9. in all theſe particulars is his Wiſdom wonderful.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As of the Goodneſs, Power, and Wiſdom of God, ſo in this New Birth there's a diſcovery of the holineſs of God. If a clod of Earth, or a piece of Muck ſhould be made a glorious Star in Heaven, it is not more wonderful, than for a ſinner to be made like an Angel, doing the Will of God; it argues the Holineſs of God, and his love of Holineſs to make man holy; He tells us that <hi>without Holineſs, none ſhall ſee God;</hi> and therefore fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>from the dayes of John the Baptiſt untill now</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth violence; for all the Prophets and the Law propheſied until John;</hi> and when the Apoſtles were ready in the Room of <hi>Judas</hi> to chooſe a new Apoſtle, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 11.21, 22.</note> that <hi>of thoſe men which companied with them all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out amongſt them, beginning from the baptiſm of John, unto the day that he was taken up, muſt one be ordained to be a witneſs.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> Preaching to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends,<note place="margin">Acts 10.37.</note> he tells them <hi>that the Word (or Goſpel) was

                     <note place="margin">Mark. 1.1, 2.</note> and ſee but how immediately theſe words follow, <hi>The beginning of the Goſpel of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>the Son of God: as it is written in the Prophets behold I ſend my Meſſenger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy face, which ſhall prepare the way before thee:</hi> I know that <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry was ſix months before Chriſt's; and yet that now was the beginning of the Goſpel, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, 1. In that Baptiſm (which was only uſed amongſt the Jews for the admiſſion of Proſelites or Heathens to their Church) is now publiſhed and propoſed to the Jews themſelves; ſhewing, 1. That now they were to be entred and tranſplanted into a new Profeſſion; and, 2. That the Gentiles, and they were now to be knit into one Church and Body. And, 2. It appears in that the Doctrine and Preaching of <hi>John</hi> was of a different ſtrain, from the litteral Doctrine of the Law; as it is taken in the ſenſe of the Jews; for that called all for works; and for exact performance, <hi>do this and live;</hi> but <hi>John</hi> called for Repentance, and for renewing of the mind, and for belief in him that was coming after, diſclaiming all righteouſneſs by the works of the Law; ſo that here was new Heavens, and a new Earth began to be created, a new Commandment given, a new Church founded, Juſtification by works cried down, and the Doctrine of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance advanced and ſet up.</p>

I read not that ever <hi>John</hi> wrought a Miracle; but he was a man of an auſtere Life: and good Works convince more than Miracles themſelves.

To this purpoſe, I ſuppoſe, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſpent his time in Prayer, Meditation, affections, and Colloquies with God, eating flies and wild honey in the wilderneſs, that he might be made a fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of preparation, and diſſemination of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In his Sermon he ſometimes gave particular Schedules of Duty to ſeveral ſtates of Perſons; he ſharply reproved the Phariſees for their hypocriſie and impiety; he gently guided others into the wayes of Righteouſneſs, calling them the <hi>ſtraight wayes of the Lord;</hi> and by ſuch diſcourſes and a Baptiſm, he diſpoſed the ſpirits of men for the entertaining of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94897:92"/> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Doctrine of the Goſpel. <hi>John</hi>'s Sermons were to the Sermons of Jeſus as a Preface to a Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>But obſerve this, that his moſt uſual Note was <hi>Repentance, the Axe to the Root, the Fan to the Floor, the Chaff to the Fire:</hi> As his Rayment was rough, ſo was his Tongue; and thus muſt the way be made for Chriſt in ſtubborn obſtinate hearts; plauſibility, or pleaſing of the fleſh is no fit Preface to Regeneration; if the heart of Man had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upright, Chriſt might have been entertained without contradiction; but now violence muſt be offered to our Corruptions, ere we can have room for Grace; if the great way-maker do not caſt down Hills, and raiſe up Vallies in the boſoms of Men, there is no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for Chriſt; never will Chriſt come into that ſoul, where the Herald of Repentance, either on one motive or other hath not been before him.</p>
                  <p>Shall we hear that Sermon that <hi>John</hi> Preached in his own words? <hi>Matthew</hi> in brief gives it in thus; <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 3.2.</note> theſe are the words when he firſt began to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt; and indeed we find Chriſt himſelf doth preach the ſame Doctrine in the ſame words: <hi>Jeſus began to Preach, and to ſay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 4.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.</hi> In this Sermon we muſt obſerve theſe two parts: here's, 1. A Duty; and, 2. A Motive to this Duty. 1. The Duty is <hi>Repent.</hi>] It is not a Legal, but an Evangelical Repentance that is here meant; indeed the Law ſtrictly takes no notice of Repentance, but the Goſpel; true, and through, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate repentance is a Goſpel-Grace. 2. The Motive is this; for <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.</hi> This Phraſe, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> hath ſeveral acceptations, and accordingly it hath occaſioned ſome differences. 1. Sometimes it is taken for that glorious condition of the other World; this may be implied; but this I ſuppoſe few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be the ſenſe of this place. 2. Sometimes it is taken for the Church of Chriſt, <hi>q. d.</hi> Repent, for now the Pedagogy of the Jews is expiring, or breathing its laſt; and the Church of Chriſt is at hand, a People that ſhall bear the very ſtile of Chriſtians; that ſhall profeſs Chriſt, and cloſe with Chriſt as their Saviour and <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> of which Church, that you may be a part, prepare for it; <hi>Repent.</hi> 3. Sometimes it is taken for the ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, in oppoſition to thoſe earthly temporal Kingdoms which bear the ſway, and domineered over all the World with Cruelty and Tyranny be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts coming; of this <hi>Daniel</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 2.44.</note> propheſied; <hi>And in the dayes of theſe Kings ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdom which ſhall never be deſtroyed.</hi> Now what was this Kingdom, but the Kingdom of Grace? It is by an Hebraiſm called the Kingdom of Heaven, that is an Heavenly Kingdom; the Jews expected the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and dreamed of an outward, glorious and pompous Kingdom: now, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, and his Kingdom is come; but 'tis not an Earthly, but an Heavenly Kingdom; and therefore <hi>Repent.</hi> 4. Sometimes it is taken for the Preaching of the Goſpel, or for the preaching of the Kingdom of Grace and Mercy of God in Chriſt unto men; <hi>q. d. O Sirs! look about you, there's now a diſcovery made of the Glory and Grace of God in another way than ever formerly; and therefore prepare for it: Repent.</hi> 5. Sometimes it is taken for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, as it is Publiſhed and Preached unto all Nations: Obſerve, I do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, for the Goſpel as it is Preached; but as it is Preached to the Gentiles, or among all Nations, and this ſhews how proper and pregnant an Argument this was to inforce the Doctrine and Practice of Repentance upon the Jews, becauſe the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles was near at hand, which would prove their rejection and caſting off, if they did not repent.</p>
                  <p>Oh how ſeaſonable is this Sermon to us? Chriſtians! hath not the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven approacht unto us? Take the Kingdom of Heaven for the Kingdom of Glory, are we not near to the door of Glory, to the Confines of Eternity? <hi>What is our Life but a Vapour that appeareth for a little time, and after it vaniſheth away?</hi> We know not but ere the Sun have run one Round, our ſouls may be in that World of ſouls, and ſo either in Heaven or Hell. Or take <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> for the Church of Chriſt, and what expectations have we now of the flouriſhing ſtate of Chriſt's Church here upon Earth? <hi>Then ſhall the Children of Iſrael and Judah be gathered together—for great ſhall be the day of Jezreel,</hi> Hoſ. 1.11. A time is at hand, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in: and what is this but <hi>the great day of Jezreel?</hi> Oh then what manner of Perſons ought we to be? How Spiritual? How Heavenly-minded? <hi>Ariſe, ariſe, ſhake off thy duſt; for thy Light is coming, and the glory of the Lord is riſing upon thee.</hi> Or, take <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> for the Preaching of the Goſpel of Grace, Mercy and Goodneſs of God in Chriſt, what Preachings are
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94897:93"/> now in compariſon of what have been formerly? How doth the Lord ſet forth his free Love, and free Grace in the Churches of Chriſt? No queſtion but many former ages have enjoyed their diſcoveries in ſome ſweet meaſure, and yet after-ages wonder that they have known no more; and how much of <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> do Saints find in this Age, as if there were a new manifeſtation of God unto the World? And yet I muſt tell you, that the Ages to come ſhall know more of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> there ſhall be further and further openings of this great Myſtery of Grace unto the Sons of Men. Mark the Apoſtle, <hi>That in the ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his Grace, in his kindneſs towards us through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2.7.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.7.</note> How is this? Had not God revealed grace enough in the former ages? Or had not God revealed Grace enough in that preſent Age? Did he not then call in the Gentiles? were not many thouſands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at one only Sermon? What a deal of that Grace had <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf received? He tells us that <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was exceeding abundant to him-wards;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.14.</note> and is there yet more Grace to be revealed? O yes! herein lies the Myſtery of Grace, that he hath reſerved exceeding riches of Grace for the Ages to come; Grace that never ſaw Light before; and I believe there is yet a fuller Magazine of the Riches of his Grace for latter Ages, even for the Ages to come, to be diſcovered, that ever was yet. Oh then repent, repent; Why? <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> The very openings of Gods Love and Grace unto Souls, is a Way and Motive to draw our Souls unto God. Or, take the Kingdom of Heaven for the preaching of the Goſpel to all Nations, Jews and Gentiles, what fears and jealouſies may this breed in us as well as the Jews: O boaſt not againſt the Branches! it may be thou wilt ſay, <hi>The Branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in: well; becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by Faith; be not high-minded, but fear: For if God ſpared not the natural Branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee. Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God; on them which felt ſeverity: but towards thee, goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou ſhalt be cut off.</hi> But I will not dwell on this: my deſign is to conſider of Jeſus, and of the tranſactions of Jeſus in reference to our ſouls health: now <hi>John</hi>'s Sermons were only a preparative to the manifeſtation of Jeſus; he was only the Forerunner of Chriſt, and not Chriſt himſelf, as himſelf witneſſeth.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. FOr the Baptiſm of Chriſt. He that formerly was circumciſed, would now be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; he was circumciſed to ſanctifie his Church that was, and he was baptized to ſanctifie his Church that ſhould be; we find him in both Teſtaments opening a way into Heaven. This was the firſt appearing of Chriſt in reference to his Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he that lay hid in the counſel of God from all eternity, and he that lay hid in the womb of his Mother for the ſpace of forty weeks, and he that lay hid in <hi>Nazareth</hi> for the ſpace of thirty years; now at laſt he begins to ſhew himſelf to the World, and <hi>He comes from Galilee to Jordan,</hi>

                     <hi>to John to be baptized of him.</hi> The day was but a little broke in <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, but Chriſt the Son of Righteouſneſs ſoon entred upon our Hemiſphere; indeed now was the full time come, that Jeſus took his leave of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Trade, to begin his Fathers work, in order to the Redemption of the World. For the clearer underſtanding of Chriſts Baptiſm, we ſhall examine theſe Particulars.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Reaſon had Chriſt to be Baptiſed?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How was it that <hi>John</hi> knew him to be Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wherein was the glory of Chriſts Baptiſm?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What was the Prayer of Chriſt, at, or after his Baptiſm?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Why was it that the Holy Ghoſt deſcended on Jeſus?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Upon what account was it that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould reveal himſelf at this time? and why in the form of a Dove rather than ſome other form?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What reaſon had Chriſt to be Baptized? we find <hi>John</hi> himſelf wondering at this; <hi>I have need to be Baptized of thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 3.15.</note> 
                     <hi>and comeſt thou to me?</hi> Many Reaſons are given for Chriſts Baptiſm: As, 1. That by this ſymbole he might enter himſelf into the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians; juſt like a King, to endear himſelf to any City of his Subjects, he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94897:93"/> condeſcends to be made a free-man of that City. 2. That he might bear witneſs to the Preaching and Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and might reciprocally receive a Teſtimony from <hi>John.</hi> 3. That by his own Baptiſm, he might ſanctifie the water of Baptiſm to his own Church. 4. That he might give an example himſelf of the performance of that, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned others. 5. That he might receive Teſtimony from Heaven, that he was the Son of God. 6. That he might <hi>fulfil all Righteouſneſs:</hi> not only the Moral, but the Figurative, Ceremonial and Typical: Some think, that the Ceremony, to which our Saviour look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in theſe words, was the waſhing of the Prieſts in water, when they entred into their Function:<note place="margin">Exod. 29.4. Lev. 8.6.</note> 
                     <hi>And Aaron and his Sons thou ſhalt bring to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and ſhalt waſh them with water.</hi> And ſurely this was the main reaſon of Chriſts being Baptized, that by this Baptiſm he might be inſtalled into his Miniſterial Office.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How did <hi>John</hi> know him to be Chriſt? It is very probable he had never ſeen his Face before; they had in their Infancy been driven to ſeveral places, and they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſeveral imployments, and never met (as we may well conceive) till now: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Baptiſt ſpeaks expreſly, <hi>I knew him not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.33.</note> 
                     <hi>but he that ſent me to Baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, on whomſoever thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on him, the ſame is he that Baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now this deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, was not till after Baptiſm; how then did he know him to be Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is given by ſome thus; that <hi>John</hi> knew Chriſt in ſome meaſure before his Baptiſm; but he knew him not ſo fully as after, when the Holy Ghoſt had deſcended on him. Others thus; that <hi>John</hi> knew Chriſt before his Baptiſm, by a preſent revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after Baptiſm by a preſent ſign; it is not unlikely but <hi>John</hi> knew Chriſt at his firſt arrival by revelation; for if whiles he was in his Mothers womb, he knew Chriſt being yet unborn, how much more might he know and acknowledg him now at his Baptiſm? Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> knew <hi>Saul;</hi> and thus <hi>John</hi> might know Chriſt. But for that knowledg he had after Baptiſm, it was a further confirmation of that ſame knowledg that he had before Baptiſm, and that not ſo much for his own ſake, as for the Peoples.<note place="margin">John 1.34.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſaw, and bear record that this is the Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wherein was the Glory or excellency of Chriſts Baptiſm? The Ancients give ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Encomiums</hi> to it, and in ſome reſpects prefer it to the Birth of Chriſt;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> Serm. 36.</note> thus <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine; Many great Miracles were at Chriſt's Birth, but they were far greater at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; the Holy Ghoſt overſhadowed him in the Womb, but he brightly ſhone on him in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; then was the Father ſilent, not a word from him, but now a loud voice is heard from Heaven, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed; then was the Mother under ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe ſhe was found with Child without a Father; but now is the Mother greatly honoured, in that the Holy Child is Fathered by God himſelf:</hi> then was Chriſt hid to the world; and this made <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſay, <hi>there ſtands one amongſt you whom ye know not:</hi> He was before his Baptiſm as the Sun in a Cloud, or a Pearl in a ſhell, or a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in a Field: but now he appears in publick; and to manifeſt his Glory, the Heavens open, and from the Heavens the Holy Ghoſt deſcends, and alights upon his ſacred head; and God the Father gives a voice from Heaven, declaring his Divinity to the world. If the <hi>Jews</hi> require a ſign, here is not one, but many ſigns at once; which as Beams do diſcover a Sun, ſo they diſcover this Sun of Righteouſneſs to be riſen amongſt them; and herein was the Glory of Chriſt's Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What was the Prayer of Chriſt, at, or after his Baptiſm? The Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 3.21.</note> ſpeaks of his Prayer. <hi>It came to paſs that</hi> Jeſus <hi>being Baptized, and Praying, the Heavens were opened.</hi> This was the manner of thoſe that were Baptized, aſſoon as they were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, to come out of the water and Pray; and ſome think that theſe words,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.36.</note> 
                     <hi>they were Baptized of him in Jordan confeſſing their ſins,</hi> hath reference to this: if ſo, then Chriſt having no ſins to confeſs of his own, the tenour of his prayer muſt needs be to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe: But to what purpoſe? ſome ſay, to the ſame purpoſe as his Prayers were uſually; as in <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>that his Father would preſerve his Church in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Truth; and that he would Glorifie his Church, that they alſo might be one, even as he and his Father are one; and eſpecially that many might be converted by his Miniſtry, which he was now beginning.</hi> Others think that this Prayer at this time, was for that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon his very prayer <hi>(i.e.) that the Holy Ghoſt might deſcend, and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would Glorifie the Son by a Teſtimony from Heaven:</hi> Indeed, the Text hath laid his Prayer, and the opening of the Heavens ſo cloſe together, as that it ſeems to point out what was the tenour of his Prayer, by the conſequent of it. Before the Heaven
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94897:94"/> was mured up, no Dove to be ſeen, no Voice to be heard, but ſtreight upon it (as if they had but waited the laſt word of his prayer) all of them follow: and in another place, we find the like return upon the like prayer;<note place="margin">John 12.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Father, Glorify thy Name: then came there a voice from Heaven, ſaying, I have both Glorified it, and I will Glorifie it again:</hi> one reaſon more, if we conſider that Chriſt was now to enter upon the great Work of our Redemption, and the preaching of the Goſpel, it will be no leſs ſtrange to conceive that he prayed for the viſible ſealing of him to that Work and Office, by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt.<note place="margin">John 6.27.</note> To this purpoſe is that of the Evangeliſt; <hi>for him hath God the Father ſealed;</hi> it is a Phraſe borrowed from them, who give their Commiſſions under hand and ſeal; and this is certain that upon his Prayer God ſent the holy Spirit, who <hi>ſealed him,</hi> or allowed, and confirmed him to the Office of our Redemption; and therefore very probable it is, that his Prayer might tend to that purpoſe; but herein take heed of excluding what was mentioned in the former opinion; for my part, I ſuppoſe Chriſts pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was both for himſelf, and all Believers; that the holy Ghoſt might now be joyned to the water; and that all others as ſhould ever after believe in his Name (as afterwards he enlargeth his Prayer) might have the Holy Ghoſt deſcend upon them, <hi>John</hi> 17.20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Why was it that the Holy Ghoſt deſcended on Jeſus? I anſwer, for theſe reaſons, 1. That <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt might be ſatisfied; for this Token was given <hi>John,</hi> when he firſt began to preach,<note place="margin">John 1.33.</note> 
                     <hi>that upon whom he ſhould ſee the Spirit deſcending, and remaining on him, the ſame is He which Baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It was a ſure ſign to the Baptiſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to know the Chriſt, whoſe Harbinger and Prodromus he was. 2. That Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might be anointed or inſtalled to his Function.<note place="margin">Iſa. 61.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to Preach good tidings unto the meek,</hi> &amp;c. As <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were anointed with material Oyl, when they entred into their Offices, ſo Chriſt was by the Spirit (as it were) anointed, that ſo he might receive this Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Inſtitution for the Office that he was to enter on, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preaching and Miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Upon what account was it that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould reveal himſelf at this time? and why in form of a Dove, rather than ſome other form?</p>
                  <p>To the firſt I anſwer, the Holy Ghoſt now revealed himſelf, becauſe the Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Scepter of Chriſt, in and by which he was to rule all Nations for ever, was now at hand.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Lightf.</hi> Harm. of the Evang.</note> It was agreeable (ſaith my Author) that the ſpiritualneſs of this Kingdom ſhould be ſealed and confirmed by the Holy Spirits ſhewing himſelf even in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. The carnal Rites of <hi>Moſes</hi> were now to vaniſh, and his Corporal and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Obſervances were now to be changed into a Spiritual Worſhip; and <hi>neither at Jeruſalem, or at Mount Gerazim, nor elſewhere,</hi> muſt there be any more adoration with fleſhly and earthly Ceremonies;<note place="margin">John 4.21, 24.</note> but he that will Worſhip God, muſt <hi>worſhip him in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Truth;</hi> and therefore it is no wonder, if now the Holy Ghoſt doth reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; I ſay now, when his Spiritual Dominion by ſanctification is to begin. Secondly, Becauſe the Holy Ghoſt was now in eſpecial manner to be reſtored again: Some obſerve, that he was viſibly departed from <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Death of the laſt Prophets; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now at his reſtoring, he comes in a viſible and apparent form; and he lights on him, to whom it belongs to give the Spirit, and his gifts to whom he pleaſeth. As <hi>John</hi> had preached that Chriſt ſhould baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, ſo now the Holy Ghoſt comes and abides on Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſight of <hi>John;</hi> as if the Father ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Now I ſeal that Power and Priviledge to Chriſt my Son, which</hi> John <hi>hath ſpoken: now the Holy Ghoſt is upon himſelf, and hereafter he ſhall baptize others with the ſame Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Thirdly, Becauſe at the beginning of the Goſpel it was moſt ſutable, that a full, clear, and ſenſible demonſtration of the whole Trinity ſhould be made. The Learned obſerve, that the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture hath a ſpecial regard to expreſs this Myſtery of the Trinity upon ſingular occaſions; ſo the very firſt thing that is taught in all the Bible,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.1, 2, 3.</note> is this ſame Myſtery; <hi>In the Begining</hi> God <hi>Created;</hi> there is the Father: and God <hi>ſaid;</hi> there is the Word, or the Son; and <hi>the Spirit of</hi> God <hi>moved;</hi> there is the Holy Ghoſt. And the very firſt word of the Bible that ſpeaks of a man, it holds out the Trinity as creating him: <hi>and</hi> God <hi>ſaid, Let us make Man in our own Image;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>let us]</hi> to ſhew the Trinity of perſons;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> and he ſaith in <hi>our Image]</hi> not in <hi>our Images,</hi> to ſhew the Unity of Eſſence. And when <hi>Moſes</hi> begins to rehearſe the Law to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the firſt thing he teacheth them, is the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our</hi> God,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.4.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord is one.</hi> The laſt word <hi>One</hi> denotes the Unity; the three
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94897:94"/> words, <hi>the Lord our God,</hi> anſwer the three Perſons; and the middle word <hi>our God,</hi> deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers fitly the ſecond Perſon, who aſſumed our Nature: how fit then was it, that at the beginning of the new world, and the new Law, and the Baptiſm of Chriſt, the three perſons ſhould be revealed; eſpecially ſince he ordained Baptiſm to be admitted in all their names? <hi>Baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,</hi>

                     <hi>and of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> But where is it revealed? ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17. where the Father ſpeaks from Heaven, the Son comes out of the water, and the holy Ghoſt appears in the likeneſs of a Dove. This was the greateſt meeting that ever was upon the earth; every perſon of the Trinity gives ſome ſenſible evidence of his preſence at it.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond; why in the form of a Dove, rather than ſome other form? Many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are given; as,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew Chriſts innocency, purity, ſimplicity, charity, and love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew what innocency and harmleſneſs ſhould be in thoſe that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To anſwer the Figure in <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood; for as a Dove at that time brought tidings of the abatings of the waters, ſo now it brings tidings of the abating of Gods wrath upon the preaching of the Goſpel: the firſt Dove we find in the Bible, is <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, with the Olive-Branch in her Bill, proclaiming peace; the next is <hi>Davids</hi> Dove with Feathers ſilver-white, as noteing ſincerity; then <hi>Eſays</hi> Dove, mourning with her voice, as ſignifying patience; and laſtly, Chriſts Dove, innocent and harmleſs; now all theſe properties meet in this Dove, the Spirit of God. Much more might I add to theſe; but I deſire to haſten to ſome more edifying truths.</p>
                  <p>From this Baptiſm of Chriſt, we may learn a practical neceſſary Truth;<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> There is a Generation that cries down Baptiſm of water, and upon this ſcore, becauſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was proper to <hi>John to Baptiſe only with water;</hi> and to Chriſt <hi>to Baptiſe only with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> Indeed Chriſt in his own perſon Baptized none otherwiſe, but with the holy Ghoſt; immediately after his Aſcenſion, he ſent his Spirit upon the Church, and baptized them with fire, the ſpirit appearing like a flame; and to this day (though not viſibly) he Baptizeth all his Saints with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire: but for all this, he appointed <hi>John,</hi> and not only <hi>John,</hi> but all his Apoſtles, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors for ever, to Baptiſe with water; and they did ſo, and yet do ſo, obeying the preceptive words of Chriſt, which are almoſt the laſt words that he ſpake upon the earth. And though Chriſt did not Baptize with water, yet Chriſt himſelf (we ſee here) was Baptized with water; he himſelf enters at that door, by which his Diſciples muſt for ever follow after him; and indeed therefore he went in at that door of Baptiſm, that he might hallow, or ſanctifie the entrance which himſelf made to the houſe he was now a Building. And for the difference they make betwixt <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Baptiſm, and <hi>John's</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: what's this to the purpoſe? we all know, that in Baptiſm are two parts, the outward part, and the inward part; you may call them (if you pleaſe) the outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the inward Baptiſm: the outward Baptiſm is of the Miniſter, but the inward Baptiſm is of Chriſt. But muſt we ſeparate theſe? or rather Joyn them (if theſe in ordinary muſt be joined) as we find them in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mark 1.4.</note> and as we deſire they may be in us? I cannot ſee, but the Baptiſm we uſe, and the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> are in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſubſtance one, and the very ſame. 1.<note place="margin">Mat. 3.15. Luk. 7.29, 30.</note> 
                     <hi>John preached the Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of Sins;</hi> they have therefore the ſame Doctrine; and the ſame Promiſe. 2. The Baptiſm Miniſtred by <hi>John,</hi> pertained to the <hi>fulfilling of all Righteouſneſs;</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifies, that the <hi>Publicans</hi> and People being Baptized of <hi>John,</hi> they <hi>Juſtified God; but the Phariſees diſpiſed the Councel of God againſt themſelves, and were not Baptized:</hi> only herein lies the difference, that <hi>John</hi> Baptized in Chriſt that ſhould die and riſe again: but we Baptize into the Name of Chriſt that is dead, and riſen again; it is a difference in reſpect of Circumſtance, but not of the Subſtance: Oh take heed of throwing away the Baptiſm of water, upon the pretence of Baptiſm, only with Fire! Chriſt (we ſee) hath joyned them together, and let no man ſeparate them aſunder: Chriſt himſelf was Baptized with fire, and yet Chriſt himſelf was Baptiſed with water.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="3">3. FOr the Faſting and Temptation of Chriſt in the Wilderneſs. No ſooner is Chriſt come out of the water of Baptiſm, but he preſently enters into the fire of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarion; no ſooner is the holy Spirit deſcended upon his head, but he is led by the ſame holy Spirit to be tempted in the wilderneſs; no ſooner doth God ſay, <hi>This my Son;</hi> but Satan puts it to the queſtion, <hi>if thou be the Son of God;</hi> all theſe are but Ghriſts prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives to his Prophetical Office; in the former Section, Chriſt was prepared by a ſolemn Conſecration, and now he is to be further prepared by <hi>Satans</hi> Temptations; there is much in this particular, and therefore in the ſame method as the Evangeliſt layes it down, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1.2, 3. to <hi>v.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">Mat. 4.1, to 12.</note> I ſhall proceed. <hi>Then was Jeſus led up of the Spirit into the Wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. In the whole, we may obſerve theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Branches, as, Firſt, the place where the Temptation was; to wit, <hi>the Wilderneſs.</hi> Secondly, the cauſe of Chriſt's going into the Wilderneſs; <hi>the Spirits leading.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the end of the ſpirits leading Chriſt into the wilderneſs; <hi>to be tempted of the Devil.</hi> Fourthly, the time and occaſion of the Devils onſet; <hi>at the end of forty dayes faſt, and when he was an hungred.</hi> Fifthly, the Temptations themſelves which are in number three; to which are added as many Victories, which Chriſt had over the Tempter; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>left him, and ſo the Angels came, and miniſtred unto him.</hi> I ſhall begin firſt with the place where the Temptation was; to wit, <hi>in the Wilderneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This wilderneſs was not that ſame wilderneſs, or not that ſame place of the wilderneſs wherein <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt lived, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.1. For that wherein <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt lived, was a place inhabited; there was in that place Cities and Towns, and a number of people to whom <hi>John</hi> Preached; but this wilderneſs was devoid of men, full of wild beaſts; ſo ſaith <hi>Mark,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 1.13.</note> 
                     <hi>He was tempted of Satan, and was with the wild Beaſts.</hi> As <hi>Adam</hi> in his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency lived with wild Beaſts and they hurt him not; ſo Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> lives, here in a wilderneſs with wild Beaſts, and he has no hurt at all; he is <hi>Adam</hi>-like in his ſafety and ſecurity; but above <hi>Adam</hi> in the reſiſting of temptation. Some ſay that in this wilderneſs, during his forty dayes abode, Chriſt was perpetually diſturbed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with evil Spirits; however the laſt brunt is only expreſſed, becauſe it was moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent; now whether they appeared in any horrid and affrighting ſhapes during that time, it is not certain; but 'tis moſt likely, that to a Perſon of ſo great ſanctity, and high deſignation as Jeſus was, they would appear more angelical and immaterial, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentments intellectual, becauſe Jeſus was not a Perſon of thoſe low weakneſſes, to be affrighted or troubled with any ugly phantaſmes; 'tis not much material to enquire of this; but in the wilderneſs (ſay they) Chriſt was perpetually tempted; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I know not, but the Devil had more advantage now he had Chriſt in a wilderneſs; ſolitarineſs is no ſmall help to the ſpeed of a Temptation; <hi>Wo to him that is alone, for if he fall, there is not a ſecond to take him up.</hi> Others ſay, that in this wilderneſs, during his forty dayes abode, Chriſt was continually exerciſed in Prayer and Faſting; all that while he had his immediate Addreſſes and Colloquies with God; he knew he had a great work of Redemption to promote; and therefore his Converſation for this interval muſt be preparatory to it; in this reſpect I know not but the wilderneſs might be an advantage to Chriſt's Deſign: In this ſolitary place he could not but breath out more pure inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Heaven uſually is more open, and God uſually is more familier and frequent in his viſits in ſuch places. I know not what other experiences may be; but if I have found any thing of God, or of his Grace, I may thank a Wood, a Wilderneſs, a Deſert, a ſolitary place, for its accommodation; and have I not a bleſſed Pattern here before me? <hi>It was Solitude and Retirement in which Jeſus kept his Vigils; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert places heard him pray; in a privacy he was born, in the wilderneſs he fed his thouſands, upon a Mountain apart he was transfigured, upon a Mountain he died, and from a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he aſcended to his Father:</hi> I make no queſtion but in theſe Retirements his Devotion received the advantage of convenient Circumſtances, eſpecially of time and place. And yet I dare not deny the firſter opinion; for I ſuppoſe both Chriſt and the Devil had their advantages of this Wilderneſs, the one is to pray, and the other to tempt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The cauſe of Chriſts going into the Wilderneſs was the Spirits leading. <hi>Then was
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94897:95"/> Jeſus led of the Spirit into the Wilderneſs;</hi> Chriſt was led by the good Spirit, to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the evil Spirit: O wonder! that ſame Spirit which was one with the Father and the Son; that ſame Spirit whereby Chriſt was conceived, now drives him or leads him into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil: The manner of Chriſt's leading is a queſtion; ſome think he was led or catcht away from <hi>Jordan</hi> in ſome viſible rapture towards the wilderneſs: But to leave that, and to come to Truths more neceſſary; Chriſt taught us to Pray unto his Father, <hi>Lead us not into temptation;</hi> and yet he himſelf is now led into the ſame temptation which we muſt pray againſt; ſurely this is for our inſtruction: we are not to thruſt our ſelves upon temptation; Chriſt himſelf would not go into the Combat uncalled, unwarranted, how then ſhould we poor weaklings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon any abilities of our own? who dares grapple with the Devil in his own ſtrength? O take heed! if we are to pray not to be led into temptation, much more are we to pray not to run into temptation before we are led; and yet for the comfort of God's people, if it be ſo that we are led; if by divine permiſſion, or by an inſpiration of the holy Spirit, we are engaged in an action, or in a courſe of life that is full of temptations, and empty of comforts, let us look upon it as an iſſue of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in which we muſt Glorifie God; but no argument of disfavour or diſlove of God: and why? becauſe Chriſt himſelf who could have driven the Devil away by the breath of his mouth, yet was, by the Spirit of his Father, led to a Tryal by the Spirits of Darkneſs. <hi>My Brethren, count it all joy</hi> (ſaith James<note place="margin">James 1.2.</note>) <hi>when ye enter into divers temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, knowing that the trial of your Faith worketh Patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The end of the Spirits leading Chriſt into the wilderneſs, it was either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, or remote. 1. For the immediate end; it was <hi>to be tempted of the Devil:</hi> to this purpoſe was Chriſt brought thither, that <hi>Satan</hi> might tempt him. One would think it a very ſtrange deſign that the Son of God ſhould be brought into a wilderneſs to be ſet on by all the Devils in Hell; but in this alſo God had another remote end <hi>(i.e.)</hi> his own Glory, and our good. 1. His own Glory appeared in this; had not <hi>Satan</hi> tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, how ſhould Chriſt have overcome <hi>Satan?</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted, and vanquiſhed; the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to repay and repair that Foil, doth vanquiſh in being tempted; now herein was the Power of Chriſt exceedingly manifeſted: the Devil having the Chain let looſe, he lets flie at Chriſt with all his might; and Chriſt, that without blows could not have got a Victory, by this furious aſſault of Satan, he both overcomes him, and triumphs over him. And herein were the Graces of Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly manifeſted; how was the Faith, Patience, Humility, Zeal and Valour of Chriſt ſet forth, which they could not have been, if he had alwayes lain quietly in Garriſon, and never had come into the Skirmiſh? Who could have felt the Odoriferous ſmells of thoſe Aromatical Spices, if they had not been punned and bruiſed in this Mortar of Temptation? It was by this means that the Graces of Chriſt clearly ſhined forth to his eternal Praiſe. 2. As it was for his Glory, ſo alſo for our Good. Now we ſee what manner of Adverſary we have, how he fights, and how he is reſiſted, and how overcome; now we ſee the dearer we are to God, the more obnoxious we are to a trial of temptation; now we ſee that the beſt of Saints may be tempted or allured to the worſt of evils; ſince Chriſt himſelf is ſolicited to Infidelity, Covetouſneſs and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: now we ſee <hi>that we have not a Saviour and High Prieſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4.15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but ſuch a one as was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſin; and therefore we may go boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may receive Mercy, and find Grace of help in time of need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The time and occaſion of the Devils Onſet; it was <hi>at the end of forty dayes Faſt, and when he was an hungred.</hi> Some ſay (as you have heard) that all thoſe forty dayes, when Chriſt was in the Wilderneſs, he was tempted only inviſibly: for Satan during that time, aſſumed not any viſible or conſpicious ſhape, which it the end of forty dayes, (ſay they) he did: my meaning is not to controvert theſe points. Howſoever for his tempting, yet for his faſting forty dayes and forty nights, there is no controverſy; and of that we had ſome Types before Chriſt came into the World; thus <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted forty dayes at the delivery of the Law; and <hi>Elias</hi> faſted forty dayes at the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law; and to fulfil the time of both theſe Types, Chriſt thinks it fit to faſt forty dayes at the accompliſhment of the Law, and the promulgation of the Goſpel. In faſting ſo long, Chriſt manifeſts his Almighty Power; and in faſting no longer, Chriſt manifeſts the truth of his Manhood, and of his weakneſs: that he might approve that there was no difference betwixt him and us, but ſin, he both faſted, and was an
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94897:96"/> hungred; we know well enough, that Chriſt could have lived without meat, and he could have faſted without hunger; it had been an eaſy matter for him to have ſupported his Body without any means of nouriſhment or Life; but to ſhew that he was man, as well as God, and ſo fit a Mediator betwixt God and Man, he would both feed and faſt; make uſe of the Creature, and withall ſuffer hunger.—And now our Saviour is an hungred; this gives occaſion to Satan to ſet upon him with his fierce and violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he knows well what baits to fiſh withall, and when and how to lay them; he hath Temptations of all ſorts; he hath Apples to cozen Children, and Gold for Men; he hath the Vanities of the World for the intemperate, and the Kingdomes of the world for the ambitious; he conſiders the temper and conſtitution of the Perſon he is to tempt; and he obſerves all our exterior Accidents, Occaſions, and Opportunities; but of this hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Temptations themſelves are in number three; whereof the firſt was this: <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread.</hi> What an horrible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is this? if <hi>thou be the Son of God;</hi> no queſtion Satan had heard the glad tidings of the Angel, he ſaw the Star, and the Journey, and the Offerings of the Sages; he could not but take notice of the gratulations of <hi>Zachary, Simeon, Anna;</hi> and of late he ſaw the Heavens open, and he heard the Voice that came down from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> and yet now that he ſaw Chriſt fainting with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as not comprehending how infirmities could conſiſt with a Godhead, he puts it to the queſtion, <hi>if thou be the Son of God.</hi> Oh here's a point in which lies all our happineſs! how miſerable were we, if Chriſt were not indeed and in truth the Son of God? Satan ſtrikes at the root in this ſuppoſition; <hi>If thou be the Son of</hi> God: Surely all the work of our Redemption, and all the work of our Salvation depends upon this one neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truth, that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is the Son of</hi> God. If Chriſt had not been the Son of God, how ſhould he have ranſomed the world? how ſhould he have done, or how ſhould he have ſuffered that which was ſatisfactory to his Fathers wrath? how ſhould his Life or Death have been valuable to the ſins of all the world? If Chriſt be not the Son of God, we are all gone; we are loſt, we are undon, we are damned for ever: O alas! farewell Glory, farewel happineſs, farewell Heaven: If Chriſt be not the Son of God, we muſt never come there; well Satan, thou beginneſt thy aſſault like a Devil indeed, <hi>if thou be the Son of</hi> God; but what then? <hi>Command that theſe ſtones be made Bread.</hi> He knew Jeſus was hungry; and therefore he invites him to eat Bread only of his own providing, that ſo he might refreſh his Humanity, and prove his Divinity: <hi>Come,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>break thy faſt upon the expence of a Miracle; turn theſe ſtones into Bread, and it will be ſome Argument thou art the Son of</hi> God. There is nothing more ordinary with our Spiritual enemy, than by occaſion of want to move us to unwarrantable courſes; <hi>If thou art poor, then ſteal; if thou canſt not riſe by honeſt meanes, then uſe indirect means:</hi> I know Chriſt might as lawfully have turned ſtones into Bread, as he turned water into Wine: but to do this in a diſtruſt of his Fathers Providence, to work a Miracle of <hi>Satans</hi> choice, and at Satans bidding, it could not be agreeable with the Son of God: And hence Jeſus refuſeth to be relieved; he would rather deny to manifeſt the Divinity of his Perſon, than he would do any act which had in it the intimation of a different ſpirit. O Chriſtians! it is a ſinfull, impious, wicked care, to take evil courſes to provide for our neceſſities: Come, it may be thou haſt found a way to thrive, which thou couldſt not do before; O take heed; was it not of the Devils prompting to change ſtones into Bread? ſadneſs into ſenſual Comforts? if ſo, then Satan hath prevailed: alas, alas, he cannot endure thou ſhouldſt live a life of auſterity, or ſelf-denial, or of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if he can but get thee to ſatisfie thy ſences, and to pleaſe thy natural deſires, he then hath a fair field for the Battle; it were a thouſand times better for us to make ſtones our meat, and tears our drink, than to ſwim in our ill-gotten Goods, and in the fulneſs of Voluptuouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>But what was Chriſt's Anſwer? why thus; <hi>it is written, man ſhall not live by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the month of</hi> God. 1. <hi>It is written]</hi> He eaſily could have confounded Satan by the Power of his Godhead, but he rather chuſes to vanquiſh him by the Sword of the Spirit; ſurely this was for our Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by this means he teacheth us how to reſiſt and to overcome; nothing in Heaven or Earth can beat the Forces of Hell, if the Word of God cannot do it: O then how ſhould we pray with <hi>David, Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes— and take not from me the words of truth, let them be my ſongs in the houſe of my pilgrimage,—
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94897:96"/> ſo ſhall I make anſwer to my blaſphemers.</hi> 2. <hi>Man ſhall not live by bread,</hi> &amp;c. Whiles we are in Gods work, God hath made a promiſe of the ſupply of all proviſions neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us; now this was the preſent caſe of Jeſus, he was now in his Father's work, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of our intereſt, and therefore he was ſure to be provided for according to God's Word. Chriſtians! are we in God's ſervice? God will certainly give us bread; and till he does, we can live by the breath of his mouth, by the light of his countinance, by the refreſhment of his promiſes, by <hi>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God;</hi> every word of God's mouth can create a grace, and every grace, can ſupply two neceſſities, both of the body, and of the Spirit: I remember one kept ſtraitly in priſon, and ſorely threatened with famine, he replied, <hi>That if he muſt have no bread,</hi> God <hi>would ſo provide, that he ſhould have no ſtomach;</hi> if our ſtock be ſpent, God can leſſen our neceſſities: If a Tyrant will take away our meat, God our Father knows how to alter our faint, and feeble, and hungry appetites.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond temptation is not ſo ſenſual; the Devil ſees that was too low for Chriſt, and therefore he comes again with a temptation ſomething more ſpiritual;<note place="margin">Ver. 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſets him on a Pinacle of the Temple, and ſaith unto him, if thou be the Son of</hi> God, <hi>caſt thy ſelf down, for it is written, he ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee,</hi> &amp;c. He that was content to be led from <hi>Jordan</hi> into the Wilderneſs, for the advantage of the firſt temptation, he yields to be led from the Wilderneſs to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for advantage of the ſecond; the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs was fit for a temptation ariſing from want, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is fit for a temptation ariſing from vain-glory; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the glory of the World, the Temple was the glory of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the pinacle was the higheſt piece of the Temple, and there is Chriſt content to be ſet for the opportunity of temptation. O that Chriſt would ſuffer his pure and ſacred body to be tranſported and hurried through the air by the malicious hand of the old Tempter! But all this was for us, he cared not what the Devil did in this way with him, ſo that he might but free us from the Devil. Methinks it is a ſweet contemplation of an Holy Divine: He ſuppoſed as if he had ſeen Chriſt on the higheſt Battlements of the Temple, and Satan ſtanding by him, with this Speech in his mouth, <hi>Well then, ſince in the matter of nouriſhment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hall.</hi>

                     <hi>thou wilt needs depend upon thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers providence, take now a further tryal of that providence, in thy miraculous preſervation, caſt down thy ſelf from this height; behold, thou art here in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the famous and holy City of the World; here thou art on the top of the Pinacle of that Temple which was dedicated to thy Father; and if thou beeſt</hi> God, <hi>why now the eyes of all men are fix'd upon thee, there cannot be deviſed a more ready way to ſpread thy Glory, and to proclaim thy Deity, than by caſting thy ſelf headlong to the Earth; all the World will ſay, there is more in thee than a man; and for danger (if thou art the Son of</hi> God) <hi>there can be none: what can hurt him that is the Son of</hi> God? <hi>and wherefore ſerves that glorious Guard of Angels, which have by Divine Commiſſion taken upon them the Charge of thy Humanity? Come, caſt thy ſelf down;</hi> here lies the temptation, <hi>Come, caſt thy ſelf down</hi> (ſaith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan) but why did not Satan caſt him down? He carried him up thither; and was it not more eaſie to throw him down thence? O no, the Devil may perſwade us to a fall, but he cannot percipitate us without our own act; his malice is infinite, but his power is limitted; he cannot do us any harm, but by perſwading us to do it our ſelves; and therefore ſaith he to Chriſt, <hi>caſt thy ſelf down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy</hi> God. Though it is true,<note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> that God muſt be truſted in, yet he muſt not be tempted; if means be allowed, we muſt not throw them away upon a pretence of God's protection: we read of one <hi>Heron,</hi> an Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of the Deſert, that he ſuffered the ſame temptation, and was overcome by it; he would needs caſt himſelf down, preſuming on God's promiſe, and he ſinfully died with his fall. Chriſt knew well enough that there were ordinary deſcents by ſtairs from the top of the Temple, and therefore he would not ſo tempt God to throw him himſelf headlong; What? To make trial of God's Power, and Juſtice, and Mercy, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary preſervation, where there was no need: all the Devils in Hell could not ſo tempt Chriſt, as to make him tempt his God.</p>
                  <p>The third temptation is yet more horrid; the Temple was not high enough; ſo that now Satan takes him up to the top of an <hi>exceeding high mountain,</hi>

                     <hi>and he ſhews him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them, ſaying, all theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me,</hi> Not to inſiſt on thoſe many Queries; how ſhould all the Kingdoms of the World be preſented to Chriſt's eye? Or if they were only preſented to his imagination, why could not the Valley have ſerved the Devil's turn, as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94897:97"/> well as an hill? or whether was not <hi>Rome</hi> the object that the Devil preſented? becauſe at that time, <hi>Rome</hi> was the top of all the Kingdoms of the world, and the Glory of them? For my part, I think, in this Temptation, the Devil united all his Power of ſtratagems, and by an angelical Power he drew into one center, the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Idea's,</hi> from all the Kingdoms and Glories of the world; and he made an admirable Map of Beauties; and repreſented them to the eyes of Jeſus; he thought Ambition more likely to ruin him, becauſe he knew it was that which prevailed upon himſelf, and all thoſe fallen ſtars, the Angels of darkneſs; and therefore, <hi>come</hi> (ſaith Satan) <hi>all theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> How? God worſhip the Devil? was ever the like Blaſphemy ſince the firſt Creation? indeed now we have many fearful, execrable, curſed Blaſphemies belched out, and Idolatry, I believe, is the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing'ſt ſin in the World; but was ever the like Blaſphemy, or Idolatry to this, that not only a Creature, but the Creator himſelf muſt fall down before the Devil, and give worſhip unto him? The Lamb of God, that heard all the former Temptations with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; he could by no means indure this; our own injuries are opportunities of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but when the Glory of God, and his immediate Honour is the queſtion, then our Zeal ſhould be all on a flame; now Chriſt bids him <hi>avoid;</hi> aſſoon as he obſerves his demands ſo impudent and Blaſphemous; he commands him away, and tells him, <hi>it is written,</hi>

                     <hi>thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Now was the Devil put to flight, and in his ſtead <hi>the Angels came and miniſtred unto Jeſus; (i.e.)</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Faſt, they miniſtred ſuch things as his neceſſities required of them.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note>O Chriſtians! what ſhall we ſay to this? if Chriſt was thus tempted by Satan, what may we look for: Sometimes it chears my heart to think that Chriſt was tempted; becauſe thereby he knows how to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted; and ſometimes it affrights my Soul to think that Satan durſt be ſo bold with Jeſus Chriſt: Oh what may he do with me? how eaſily may he prevail againſt my Soul? when he came to tempt Chriſt, he found nothing in him to join with him in the temptation, but in my heart is a world of Corruptions; and unleſs the Lord prevent, I am quickly gone. I may not here fall on the Doctrine of Temptations; only a few words. 1. Of Satans Stratagems. 7. Of ſome general means to withſtand his Stratagems, and I have done.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His Stratagems are very many, and very dangerous; As, —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He obſerves, and fits his temptations to our diſpoſitions; for example, if he find a man ambitiouſly affected, then he covers his hook with the Bait of Honours; and thus he tempted <hi>Abimelech</hi> to murder his Brethren, that he might obtain the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; or if he find a man Voluptuouſly given, then he tempts him with the bait of Pleaſures, and thus he allured <hi>Noah</hi> to Drunkenneſs; <hi>David</hi> to Adultery; <hi>Solomon</hi> to Idolatry: or if he find a man Covetouſly given, then he lets in the Golden hook; and thus he enticed <hi>Balaam,</hi> by offering him money to curſe the people, whom God had Bleſſed; and thus he allured <hi>Judas</hi> for thirty pieces of Silver to betray his Maſter; but what need we Inſtances, when we ſee this day ſo many thouſands intangled in this golden Net?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He obſerves, and fits his Temptations to our Complections; and thus he tempts the cholerick to quarrels and brawls; the flegmatick to idleneſs and ſloath; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy to malice and revenge; the ſanguine to pleaſure and fleſhly luſts; and hence it is that the Apoſtles tells us,<note place="margin">James 1.14.</note> that <hi>whoſoever is tempted, he is drawn away by his own Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence.</hi> Satan never aſſaults us, but he is ſure there is ſomething within us, that will further him in his temptations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He obſerves, and fits his temptations to our outward conditions; thus if we are in proſperity, then he tempts us to pride and forgetfulneſs of God, to contempt of our Brethren, to the love of the world, to coldneſs in Religion, carnal ſecurity, and the like: or if we are in adverſity, then he tempts us to the uſe of unlawful means, to the diſtruſting of God's all-ruling providence, and never deceiving-promiſes; or, it may be, to deſpair, murmur, and repining againſt God; by this temptation he confidently preſumed to have moved Chriſt to diſtruſt God's providence, and to ſhift for himſelf, by turning ſtones into Bread.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He obſerves, and fits his temptations to our ſpiritual eſtate; thus, if we are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wicked, then he tempts us to Atheiſm, contempt of God's worſhip, ſwearing, blaſpheming, prophaining of the Lords dayes; to diſobedience, murders, adulteries, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, theft, covetuouſneſs, and all deviliſh practiſes; or if we are civilized, and run not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94897:97"/> with others into ſuch an exceſs of riot and ſin, why then he tempts us to a good opinion of ſuch a condition, <hi>I thank thee, O Father, that I am not as other men, &amp;c. I deal juſtly and uprightly with all my Neighbours; I have a good meaning towards God, though I am ignorant of Scripture, and of the Principles of Religion:</hi> or if we are profeſſors of God's Truth, and can tip our tongues with Glorious words of Religion, Holineſs, Chriſt, why then he tempts us with reſting on this: <hi>What needs more? If I can but outwardly perform the Duties of Piety, as the hearing of God's word, receiving of the Sacraments, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private calling on</hi> God; <hi>in this I am a true Proteſtant: that Charity, Love, good Works, and all the duties of the ſecond Table can never Juſtifie me, or ſave me, but only Faith; I believe, and I make a profeſſion of Religion, and I hope this will ſuffice:</hi> Or if we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profeſſors, and but weak in the Faith, why then he tempts us with ſad thoughts of our ſins; he ſets before us their number, and nature, and odiouſneſs in every aggravation; and if therewith he cannot overwhelm us, he adds (it may be) unto them ſome of his own ſins; thus he caſteth into our minds many outragious Blaſphemies, ſuch Blaſphemies as he propounded to Chriſt, to worſhip him for our God, to deny Jeſus Chriſt as our God, our Lord, our Saviour, our Redeemer; to ſay in our hearts there is no God, but Nature; no Scripture, no Holy Ghoſt: many a pretious Soul feels theſe injections of Satan; and I cannot wonder at it, when I ſee the Devil tempting Chriſt himſelf to diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, preſumption, vain-Glory, yea, and to the worſhiping of the Devil himſelf; or if we are ſtrong Chriſtians, grown men, and ſtill growing towards the fulneſs of Chriſt, why then he tempts us to ſins of preſumption againſt knowledg; or if he cannot ſo prevail, he will <hi>Transform himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> and tempt us to the doing a leſs good, that we may neglect a greater; or to the doing of a greater good, but very unſeaſonably. When as ſome other duties in reſpect of preſent occaſion are more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far; thus many times in the hearing of God's Word, he will caſt into our minds medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this or that excellent ſubject, on purpoſe to diſtract our minds, and to make us hear without profit; and in Prayer to God, he will bring into our memories this or that profitable inſtruction, which we have heard at ſuch, or ſuch a Sermon, on purpoſe to diſturb our Spirits in that holy exerciſe, and to keep us from lifting up our hearts wholly and purely unto God: I might add a thouſand of theſe ſtratagems of the Devil, and yet not perhaps tell one of a thouſand: the Apoſtle could ſay indeed,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11. Eph. 6.11. Rev. 2.24. Eph. 6.16.</note> that he was <hi>not ignorant of his devices;</hi> and of ſome of his devices, you ſee, we are not ignorant; but alas! who can diſcover all his <hi>Methods, Wiles, Depths, fiery Darts?</hi> For my part I cannot do it, I am yet to learn.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The general means to withſtand his Stratagems are ſuch as theſe.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A continual reminding of Chriſt's Commands in this very thing; <hi>Be ſtrong in the Power of his might: put on the whole Armour of</hi> God,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.10, 11. 1 Pet. 5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil; him reſiſt in the Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. An avoiding of the firſt ſuggeſtions of <hi>Satan;</hi> if this gliding Serpent can but thruſt in his head, he will eaſily make room for his body; and therefore we muſt nip, and bruiſe him in the head; <hi>Give no place to the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. An objecting of Chriſt againſt all his temptations; for example,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.27.</note> if <hi>Satan</hi> tell us that we are miſerable ſinners; we may anſwer,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.13. Iſa. 53.5.</note> that <hi>Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners; and that he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and broken for our iniquities,— and with his ſtripes are we healed:</hi> If <hi>Satan</hi> tell us that we are ſubject to God's wrath; we may anſwer, that Chriſt did bear his Fathers wrath, that he might make our peace: If he tells us, that we are ſubject to the Curſe of the Law; we may anſwer, that <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, when he was made a Curſe for us:</hi> If he tell us, that we are his bondſlaves, we may anſwer, that we were ſo indeed in times paſt;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> but Chriſt hath paid his Father the price of our Redemption, and hath ſet us free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he tell us, that we are unjuſt, and therefore ſhall be condemned before God's judgment-ſeat, we may anſwer, that Chriſt, who was Innocent, was therefore condemned, that we, who are guilty, might thereby be acquitted; and that he that came to ſave us, will himſelf judg us, and therefore we need not doubt of mercy, if we plead the merits of Chriſt: or if <hi>Satan</hi> will not be thus anſwered by us; why then Chriſtians! there's no other way, but to ſend him to Chriſt: to this purpoſe, we may tell him that Chriſt is our Advocate; and if he will needs diſpute, let him go to <hi>Jeſus;</hi> he is both able to plead our cauſe, and to anſwer to all the Suits that are made againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I may add hearing, reading, meditating on God's Word, holy Conferences, buſie em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94897:98"/> in the works of our particular callings; living by Faith, I muſt not ſtay on all theſe means,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> only remember amongſt the reſt, that one of Chriſt: <hi>Watch and Pray, that ye enter not into temptation;</hi> Praying againſt it, is a denying of it, and a great part of the victory; for it is a diſclaiming the entertainment of it; it is a poſitive rejection of the crime; it is a calling in auxiliaries from above, to make the victory more certain to us. Hence one ſweetly adviſeth, <hi>If temptation ſets upon thee, do thou ſet upon God; for he is as ſoon overcome as thou art; as ſoon moved to good, as thou art to evil; he is as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited to pitty thee, as thou art to ask him; provided thou doſt not finally reſt in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, but paſs into action, and indeavour by all meanes to quench the flame newly kindled in thy bowels, before it come to devour the marrow that is in thy bones:</hi> indeed a ſtrong prayer, and a lazy, incurious, unobſervant walking are contradictions in Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Watch and Pray, and pray and watch.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p n="4">4. FOr the firſt Manifeſtation of Jeſus by his ſeveral witneſſes; now it was time that <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhould ariſe,</hi> and ſhine in the view of the world: and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of unbelief which had blinded the world) that ſome eſpecial witneſſes ſhould be choſen out,<note place="margin">John 1.45. 1 Tim. 3.16. 1 Pet. 1.20.</note> both to anoint our eyes, and to point to the light, ſaying, <hi>This is he of whom Moſes in the Law and the Prophets did write, Jeſus of Nazareth the Son of Joſeph:</hi> to this purpoſe we read much of <hi>the manifeſtation of Jeſus; God was manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi> And Chriſt <hi>verily was fore-ordained before the foundations of the World, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you.</hi> In that firſt Miracle that ever he wrought, this is written upon it,<note place="margin">John 2.11. 1 John 1.2.</note> 
                     <hi>he manifeſted forth his Glory.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> the Divine, in his ſetting out of Jeſus, he tells us, that <hi>the Life was manifeſted; and we have ſeen it, and bear witneſs, and ſhew unto you that eternal Life which was with the Father, and was manifeſted unto us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is reaſon for this manifeſtation. 1. Becauſe every manifeſtation was an approbation of his Miſſion and Divinity. 2. Becauſe in the manifeſtation of Chriſt, there was a manifeſtation of the Grace of God; and this was the Will of God, that he would not only act free Grace, but he would have it known, and publiſhed to all the world; this is the Glory of Grace, and ſets it out: And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11. Tit. 3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>hath appeared to all men.</hi> At the opening and diſcovery of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the kindneſs, and pity, and love of</hi> God <hi>our Saviour towards man appeared.</hi> 3. Becauſe this manifeſtation hath ſomething in it of the removal of ſin; it is the voice of Chriſt unto ſuch as are in ſin,<note place="margin">Iſa. 65.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold me;</hi> the firſt ſtep towards the remiſſion of Sins, is the beholding of Chriſt; now we cannot behold him that will not come into view:<note place="margin">1 John 3.5.</note> and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ye know that he was manifeſted to take away our ſins.</hi> 4. Becauſe this manifeſtation hath ſomething in it to the overthrowing of Satan; for the while that Chriſt hid himſelf, Satan blinded the minds of men; but when once <hi>Chriſt the Image of God ſhone forth,</hi> then Satan, like Lightning fell down from Heaven;<note place="margin">1 John 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> 5. Becauſe this manifeſtation tends to our believing in Chriſt, and by conſequence to our Salvation through Chriſt:<note place="margin">John 20.30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Many ſigns Chriſt did in the preſence of his diſciples which are not written; but theſe are written,</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) that ye might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus is Chriſt the Son of</hi> God; <hi>and that believing, ye might have life through his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but wherein was this firſt manifeſtation of Jeſus? I anſwer, in thoſe ſeveral witneſſes that held him forth:<note place="margin">John 8.17.</note> 
                     <hi>It is written in the Law</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of of two men is true;</hi> but to manifeſt Chriſt, were many witneſſes. As, 1. From Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Father is witneſs;<note place="margin">John 8.18. John 8.14.</note> for ſee, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the Father that ſent me, beareth witneſs of me:</hi> and the Son is witneſs; for ſo ſaith Chriſt: <hi>I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf;</hi> and <hi>though I bear record of my ſelf, yet my record is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 10.19.</note> and the Holy Ghoſt is witneſs; ſo faith <hi>Paul: The Holy Ghoſt alſo is a witneſs to us:</hi> and to that purpoſe he deſcended like a Dove, and light upon him. 2. On Earth <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt is witneſs:<note place="margin">Mat. 3.16. John 5.33. John 1.7.</note> for ſo ſaith Chriſt; <hi>ye ſent unto John, and he bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the truth,—he came for a witneſs, to bear witneſs of the Light, that all men through Chriſt might believe.</hi> No ſooner was <hi>John</hi> confirmed by a ſign from Heaven, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, but he immediately manifeſts it to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and firſt to the Prieſts
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94897:98"/> and Levites ſent in legation from the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> he profeſſed indefinitely in anſwer to their queſtion, that himſelf was not the Chriſt, nor <hi>Elias,</hi> nor that Prophet, whom they by a ſpecial tradition expected to be revealed, though they knew not when; and ſecondly, to all the People he profeſſeth definitely, whereſoever he ſaw Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>this is he:</hi> yea, he points him out with his finger,<note place="margin">John 1.29.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the World.</hi> Then he ſhews him to <hi>Andrew, Simon Peter</hi>'s Brother, and then to another Diſciple with him, <hi>who both followed Jeſus, and abode with him all night.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.39.</note> 
                     <hi>Andrew</hi> brings his Brother <hi>Simon</hi> with him, and Chriſt changes his Name from <hi>Simon</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Cephas, which ſignifies a Sone.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 42. Ver. 43. Ver. 44. Ver. 47.</note> Then Jeſus himſelf findes out <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> and bade him <hi>follow him;</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> finds out <hi>Nathanael,</hi> and bids him <hi>come and ſee,</hi> for the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was found; when <hi>Nathanael</hi> came to Jeſus, Chriſt ſaw his heart, and gave him a bleſſed Character; <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</hi> Thus we ſee no leſs than five Diſciples found out at firſt, which muſt be as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witneſſes of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And yet we find more witneſſes; <hi>The works</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that I do, in my Fathers name, they bear witneſs of me.</hi> Theſe Works or Miracles of Chriſt were many;<note place="margin">John 10.25.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſpeaking of his firſt manifeſtation, I ſhall inſtance only in his firſt work, which was at a Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee.</hi> The power of Miracles had now ceaſed ſince their return out of Captivity; the laſt Miracle that was done by man till this very time, was <hi>Daniel</hi>'s tying up the mouth of the Lions; and now Chriſt begins. He that made the firſt Marriage in Paradiſe, beſtows his firſt Miracle upon a Marriage-Feaſt: O happy Feaſt, where Chriſt is a Gueſt! I believe this was no rich or ſumptuous Bridal; who ever found Chriſt at the magnificent Feaſts, or Triumphs of the great? The ſtate of a Servant (in which ſtate Chriſt was) doth not well agree with the proud pomp of the World: This poor needy Bridegroom wants drink for his Gueſts; and aſſoon as the Holy Virgin hath notice of it, ſhe complains to her Son: whether we want Bread, or Water, or Wine, Neceſſaries, or Comforts, whether ſhould we go but to Chriſt? <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd;</hi> and if that be ſo, it wall ſurely follow, <hi>I ſhall not want:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 23.1. John 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>But Jeſus anſwered her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</hi> This ſhews, that the work he was to do, muſt not be done to ſatisfie her importunity, but to proſecute the great work of divine deſignation. In works ſpiritual and religious, all outward relation ceaſeth: Matters of Miracle concerned the Godhead only; and in this caſe, <hi>O Woman, what have I to do with thee?</hi> We muſt not deny Love, and Duty to Relations; but in the things of God, natural Endearments muſt paſs into ſpiritual; and like Stars, in the preſence of the Sun, muſt not appear. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh; yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.16.</note> 
                     <hi>yet now henceforth know we him no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the Command of Jeſus, the water pots were filled with water, and the water by his Divine Power is turned into Wine; where the different diſpenſation of God and the world is highly obſervable: <hi>Every man ſets forth good Wine at firſt and then the worſe:</hi> But Chriſt not only turns water into Wine, but into ſuch Wine that at the laſt Draught is moſt pleaſant: the world preſents us with fair hopes of pleaſures, honours, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but there's bitterneſs in the end: every ſin ſmiles in the firſt addreſs; <hi>but when we have well drunk, then comes that which is worſe;</hi> only Chriſt turns our water into Wine; if we fill our water-pots with water; if with <hi>David,</hi> we water our Couch with our tears for ſin, Chriſt will come with the Wine of gladneſs ſooner or latter; and he will give the beſt wine at the laſt. O how delicate is that new Wine, which we ſhall one day drink with Chriſt in his Fathers Kingdom? Theſe were the firſt manifeſtations of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: you ſee he had ſeveral witneſſes to ſet him forth; ſome from Heaven, and ſome on earth; the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt witneſs from Heaven; The Baptiſt, Diſciples, and his works witneſs on earth; and there's no diſagreement in their witneſs, but all bring in this teſtimony of Jeſus, that he is the <hi>Meſſiah; that is being interpreted,</hi>

Oh Chriſtians! how cheap are the myſteries of the Goſpel to you ward? you may know them, if you will but lend an ear, and liſten to them: the word is nigh you, even in your mouths; Chriſt is proclaimed in your very ſtreets; you may have him if you will, without mony or mony-worth: <hi>Come, buy Wine,</hi>

When <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Goſpel in general,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.16. 2 Pet. 1.10.

                     <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> Of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Whipping the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple.</head>
                  <p n="5">5. COncerning Chriſt's whipping the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple: we read in the Goſpel, <hi>That the Jews Paſſover being at hand, Jeſus went up to Jeruſalem:</hi> Thither,<note place="margin">John 2.13.</note> if we follow him, the firſt place that we find him in, is the Temple; where, by the occaſion of the National Aſſembly, was an opportune Scene for Chriſt's tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of his Fathers buſineſs. In that Temple Chriſt firſt eſpies a Mart; there were divers Merchants, and Exchangers of Money, that brought Beaſts thither to be ſold for ſacrifice againſt that great Solemnity; at the ſight of which, Jeſus being moved with Zeal and Indignation, he makes a Whip of Cords, and according to the cuſtom of the <hi>Zealots</hi> of the Nation, he takes upon him the Office of a private inflictor of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he drives them all out of the Temple, he overthrows the accounting Tables, and commands them that ſold the Doves, to take them from thence; and being required to give
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94897:99"/> a ſign of this fact; he only foretels the Reſurrection of his Body, after three dayes death, expreſſing it in the Metaphor of the Temple, which was never rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood till it was accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>In this heroical act, we may ſee how Chriſt is carried on with a Zeal for God, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it brings to mind that ſaying of the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.9.</note> 
                     <hi>The Zeal of thine Houſe hath eaten me up;</hi> a Metaphor taken from Men that receive nouriſhment, which after its ſeveral concoctions, is aſſimilated into the nature of them that receive it. Zeal doth totally ſurprize us in what concernes God; in our Zeal we do ſo mind the things of God, as if we minded no nothing elſe. To what dangers, hazards, and cenſures, did Chriſt here in the exerciſe of the Zeal expoſe himſelf? His eminent Zeal appears,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the weakneſs of his means, whereby he did both attempt, and effect the work: we find him not armed with any weapons, that might carry dread and terrour with them; at moſt but with a Whip made of a few ſmall Cords, which probably were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Drovers which came thither to ſell their Cattel.—2. In the ſtrength that the oppoſite power did hold out, which makes the encounter ſo much the more dangerous: As, 1. A Garriſon of Soldiers ready at hand, to appeaſe occaſional tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults. 2. The temper of thoſe mens ſpirits with whom the buſineſs was;<note place="margin">Cham. in loc.</note> they were men ſet upon gain, the World's God. 3. The great Confluence of the people, it being the moſt ſolemn Mart of the Paſſover: O what a Zeal was this! that neither the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the means, on the one ſide, to effect it, nor the greatneſs of the power, on the other ſide, to hinder it, did at all diſmay him, or cauſe him to deſiſt; ſeem he never ſo weak, or be they never ſo ſtrong, he whips them out of the Temple, and bids them be gone.</p>
                  <p>This action of Chriſt fulfils that Propheſie of <hi>Malachy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple; but who may abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth? for he is like Refiners fire, and like Fullers Sope; and he ſhall ſit as a Refiner and Purifier of Silver, and he ſhall purifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>and purge them as Gold and as Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an Offering in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the main we may obſerve, that <hi>a perſwaſion of Chriſt's preſence in our Church-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, is a ſpecial means or motive to bring all into order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is this preſence of Chriſt in Church-aſſembles? If by Chriſt's preſence, we mean his bodily preſence, it is true, that Chriſt in his Humanity, whipped the Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sellers out of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> then in his Manhood he was upon Earth, and accordingly he vouchſafed his bodily preſence to their aſſemblies and publick places; but now his Manhood is in Heaven;<note place="margin">Acts 3.21.</note> and the <hi>Heavens muſt contain him till the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things:</hi> Now therefore we cannot expect his bodily preſence, unleſs we will maintain the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, or of Conſubſtantiation; which far be it from us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If by Chriſt's preſence, we mean his ſpiritual preſence; then the queſtion is, what is this ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt? for if we ſay, it is his preſence as he is God, I ſhould then query, how God is ſaid to be preſent with men in one place more than another? God in his eſſence is fully every where, and incluſively no where: Heaven is his Throne, and Earth is his Footſtool, and yet nor Earth, nor Heaven, nor the Heaven of Heavens is able to contain him: whiles we ſpeak ſpiritually of Chriſt's preſence in the aſſemblies of his People, we cannot mean his Univerſal preſence, but his eſpecial preſence; and therefore as yet I ſuppoſe we have not the meaning of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If by Chriſt's preſence we mean the preſence, of his Spirit either in himſelf, or eſpecially in his workings, ſtirrings, actings and movings in our Spirit, I ſhould then ſubſcribe; only I think this is not all that is included in his eſpecial preſence; true it is that when Chriſt was upon Earth, he told his Diſciples that he muſt go away; for if he went not away, the Comforter would not come unto them;<note place="margin">John 16.7.</note> 
                     <hi>But if I depart</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I will ſend him unto you;</hi> and accordingly, when that Church-aſſembly was convened at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> God ſent the Holy Ghoſt; much people being then gathered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that it might be divulged to all the World. To all the Aſſemblies of the Saints, Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his Spirit, though not alwayes in a viſible manner;<note place="margin">Mat. 8.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Where two or three are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in my name</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>there I am in the midſt of them.</hi> Chriſt in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in the midſt of us, ſtirring and moving in our ſpirits: or the ſpirit of Unity is with united ſpirits. O he is a ſweet Spirit, a Spirit of Love, and Concord, and Peace, and Glory; and therefore where ſhould he be but with thoſe that make harmony upon Earth? He is with them, and amongſt them, and in them;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94897:100"/> of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,</hi> and worketh in you?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If by Chriſt's preſence, we mean the preſence of his Angels, I ſhall then ſay, we have ſaid enough; as a King is ſaid to be where his Court is, where his Train or Retinue are, ſo Chriſt the King of Kings is there eſpecially preſent, where the Heavenly Guard, the bleſſed Angels keep their ſacred Station and Rendezvouz, whereſoever it is. Now that this is Chriſt's ſpecial preſence, it will appear in ſundry Texts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw that viſion in <hi>Bethel,</hi> of the Ladder reaching from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.16, 17</note> and of the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending upon it, <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jacob) the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not; and he was afraid, and ſaid, how dreadful is this place? this is none other but the Houſe of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven:</hi> He calls it <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Houſe,</hi> where God and his holy Angels, who are of his Houſhold are eſpecially preſent; and he calls it <hi>the Gate of Heaven,</hi> Heaven's Guild-Hall, Heaven's Court, namely, becauſe of the Angels; for the Gate, Guild-Hall, or Court was wont to be the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Hall, and the place where Kings and Senators uſed to ſit, attended by their Guard and Miniſters. The <hi>Caldee</hi> addeth, <hi>This is no common or private place, but a place wherein God taketh pleaſure, and over againſt this place is the Gate of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Lord deſcended upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to give the Law, ſome place the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification of God's preſence in the Angels, to which purpoſe are alledged theſe Texts; <hi>Who have received the Law by the diſpoſition of Angels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 7.53. Gal. 3.19. Heb. 2.2.</note> 
                     <hi>and have not kept it:</hi> and again, <hi>The Law was ordained by Angels in the Hand of a Mediator.</hi> Again, the Apoſtle calls the Law <hi>the Word ſpoken by Angels.</hi> I have already delivered my thoughts concerning theſe Angels; but ſome (I ſay) conclude from hence, that the ſpecial preſence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty conſiſts in the encamping of his ſacred Retinue, the bleſſed Angels; for that the Lord of himſelf, who filleth Heaven and Earth, could not deſcend, or be in one place more than another: There's yet another Text very pertinent to this. <hi>And he ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 33.2.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord came from Sinai, and roſe up from Seir unto them, he ſhined forth from Mount Paran, and he came with ten thouſands of his Saints, from his right hand went a fiery Law for them:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 68.17.</note> the words tranſlated <hi>ten thouſand of his Saints,</hi> are in the Original <hi>ten thouſands of Sanctity,</hi> or <hi>holy ten thouſands,</hi> or <hi>holy Myriads;</hi> which in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, points to the Angels, rather than his Saints: and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> puts it out of queſtion: <hi>The Chariots of God are twenty thouſand, even thouſands of Angels, the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy Place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. After the Law given, this preſence of God was fixed to the Temple; and what that was,<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribe thus; <hi>I ſaw alſo the Lord ſitting upon a Throne, high, and lifted up, and his train filled the Temple; about it ſtood the Seraphims;</hi> They were God's Train, and they filled the Temple.

                     </gap>, <hi>before the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> I know in the time of the Goſpel, we do not ſo fix God's preſence to our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or places of publick aſſembling for the worſhip of his Name; but to our Church-aſſemblies in ſuch places, why may we not? Were the Rudiments of the Law worthy of an attendance of Angels, and are the Churches of the Goſpel deſtitute of ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Retinue? Did the bleſſed Spirits wait upon the Types, and do they decline the Office at the miniſtration of the ſubſtance? Is the Nature of Man made worſe, ſince the Incarnation of the Son of God? Or have the Angels purchaſed an exemption from their Miniſtry, ſince Chriſt became our Brother in the fleſh? We have little reaſon to think ſo; the Apoſtle treating of a comely and decent demeanor to be obſerved in Church-aſſemblies, and in particular, of women's being covered or veiled there, he enforces it from this preſence of Angels:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.10. <hi>Chryſ hom.</hi> 16. in 1 Cor. <hi>hom.</hi> 15. in Heb.</note> 
                     <hi>For this cauſe ought the Woman to have a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering on her head, becauſe of the Angels;</hi> namely, which are there preſent. Upon this ground, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> reproves the irreverent behaviour of his Auditory; <hi>The Church,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not a Shop of Manufactures or Merchandize, but the place of Angels, and of Archangels, the Court of God, and the Image and Repreſentment of Heaven it ſelf.—I know thou ſeeſt them not; but hear, and know that Angels are every where, and eſpecially in the Houſe of</hi> God, <hi>where they attend upon their King, and where all is filled with incorporeal powers.</hi> By this time, I hope, we know what is the meaning of Chriſt's preſence in Church-aſſemblies; to wit, the preſence of his Spirit, and the preſence of his Angels.</p>

Then Chriſt proceeds in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, telling him yet of higher things, as of his deſcent from Heaven, of his Paſſion and Aſcenſion, and of the Mercy of Redemption, which he came to work and effect for all that believe; of the Love of the Father, the Miſſion of the Son, the Rewards of Faith, and Glories of Eternity: and this was the Sum of his Sermon to <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> which was the fulleſt of myſtery and ſpeculation that ever he made, except that which he made immediately before his death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now was it that the throng of Auditors forcing Chriſt to leave the ſhore, he makes <hi>Peter's</hi> ſhip his Pulpit;<note place="margin">Luke 5.1, 2, 3, 4</note> never were there ſuch Nets caſt out of that Fiſher-boat before; whiles he was upon land, he healed the Sick bodies by his touch; and now he was upon Sea, he cured the ſick ſouls by his Doctrine; he that made both Sea and Land, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth both to conſpire to the opportunities of doing good to the ſouls and bodies of men.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <note place="margin">Luke 4.18.</note>4. Now it was that he Preached that bleſſed <hi>Sermon</hi> on that text, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to Preach the Goſpel to the Poor:</hi> no queſtion but he Preached both to poor and rich, Chriſt Preached to all: but for the Power and Fruit of his Preaching, it was only received and entertained by the poor in ſpirit. In the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars, his Office is ſet out ſtill in an higher tenour, <hi>To heal the broken heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to Preach deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind,</hi> or as it is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound;</hi> a ſad thing to be in captivity, but ſadder to be bound in chains, or lockt up in a priſon there; but 'tis moſt ſad of all to be impriſoned, having ones eyes put out; as it was the caſe of <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> Now the Evangeliſt willing to render the Prophet to the higheſt comfortable ſence that might be, he uſeth an expreſſion that meets with the higheſt myſtery; that is, when a man is not only ſhut up in a blinded Priſon, when he himſelf alſo hath his eyes put out; and to ſuch Chriſt ſhould Preach; Preach what? not only deliverance to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,<note place="margin">Luke. 4.48.</note> but alſo reſtoring of Light to Captive Priſoners, nay yet more, <hi>recovering of ſight to blinded Priſoners,</hi> as the Evangeliſt renders it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now it was that he delivered the admirable <hi>ſermon,</hi> called <hi>The Sermon upon the Mount.</hi> It is a breviary of all thoſe Precepts which are truly called Chriſtian; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it all the moral Precepts given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and opens a ſtricter ſence, and more ſevere expoſition than the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had given; it holds forth the Doctrines of meekneſs, poverty of ſpirit, Chriſtian mourning, deſire of Holy things, mercy, and purity, peace, and patience, and ſuffering of injuries; he teacheth us how to pray, how to faſt, how to give Alms, how to contemn the world, and how to ſeek the Kingdom of God, and its appendent righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And thus Chriſt being entred upon his Prophetical Office; in theſe and the reſt of his <hi>ſermons</hi> he gives a clear teſtimony that he was not only an interpreter of the Law, but a Law-giver; and that this Law of Chriſt might retain ſome proportion at leaſt with the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſt in his laſt <hi>ſermon</hi> went up into a Mountain, and from thence gave the Oracle. I cannot ſtand to paraphraſe on this, or any other of his <hi>ſermons,</hi> but ſeeing now we find Chriſt in the exerciſe of his Prophetical Office, let us obſerve firſt his Titles in this reſpect. 2. The reaſons of his being a Prophet. 3. The Excellency of Chriſt above all other Prophets, and then we have done.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THe Titles of Chriſt in reſpect of his Prophetical Office were theſe: 1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is called Doctor, or Maſter, <hi>Be ye not called Maſters,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23.10.</note>

                     </gap> which ſignifies a Doctor, Moderator, teaching-Maſter, a guide of the way. 2. Sometimes he is called a Law-giver,<note place="margin">James 4.12.</note> 
                     <hi>There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the internal Government of the Conſcience, in which caſe the Lord is our Judge,<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.22.</note>

Iſa. 9.6. Prov. 8.14.</note> Sometimes he is called a Councellor, and <hi>his name ſhall be called Wonderful, Councellor; Counſel is mine and ſound Wiſdom,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I am underſtanding, and I have ſtrength.</hi> Chriſt by his Office counſels men how to fly ſin, and how to pleaſe God, and how to eſcape Hell,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.1.</note> and how to be ſaved. 4. Sometimes he is called the Apoſtle of our profeſſion, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holy brethren, partakers of the Heavenly calling, conſider the Apoſtle, and High Prieſt of our profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> God ſent him as an Embaſſadour to make known his will; he came not unſent, the very word imports a Miſſion, a ſending,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> 
                     <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> let all thoſe who run before they be ſent, take notice of this, for this would not Chriſt do; he was ſent, he was the Apoſtle of our profeſſion. 5. Sometimes he is called the Angel of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> 
                     <hi>even the Angel of the Covenant whom ye delight in.</hi> Chriſt was the publiſher of the Goſpel-Covenant, he declared the Gracious purpoſe of God towards the Elect held forth in the Covenant; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he is called <hi>a Prophet, Acts</hi> 3.22. and <hi>the Prophet,</hi> John 7.40. and <hi>that Prophet,</hi> John 6.14.<note place="margin">John 6.14.</note> 
                     <hi>this is of a truth that Prophet that ſhould come into the World;</hi> whoſe Office it was to impart Gods will unto the Sons of Men, according unto the name, <hi>Angel.</hi> 6. Sometimes he is called the Mediatour of the New-Covenant,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.15.</note> 
                     <hi>for this cauſe he is the Mediatour of the New-Teſtament,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; now, a Mediatour is ſuch a one as goes betwixt two parties at variance, imparting the mind of the one to the other, ſo as to breed a right underſtanding, and thereby to work a complyance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both: and thus Chriſt is a Mediatour betwixt God and us. By him it is that the mind and will of God is imparted to man, <hi>no man hath ſeen God at any time;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.18.</note> 
                     <hi>the only begotten Son, which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him:</hi> and by him it is that we impart our mind unto God, <hi>The ſmoak of the incenſe which goes with the prayers of the Saints, aſcends up before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> This was typified in <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 8.4.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſtood between the Lord and you at that time, to ſhew you the Word of the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 5, 5.</note> The Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar renders it thus, <hi>Ego ſequeſtor &amp; medius,</hi> I was a Mediatour, a Midler betwixt God and you: and ſo Chriſt Jeſus he is a Mediatour, a Midler, an Interpreter, an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſenger betwixt God and his People.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reaſons of Chriſts being a Prophet, were theſe: 1. That he might reveal and deliver to his people the will of his Father. 2. That he might open and expound the ſame being once delivered. 3. That he might make his Saints to underſtand, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſame being once opened.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As a Prophet he delivers to the people his Fathers will, both in his own Perſon, and by his Servants the Miniſters. In his own Perſon when he was upon earth as a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Circumciſion;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.8. Heb. 2, 3.</note> and by his Servants the Miniſters from the beginning of their miſſion till the end of the World; Thus the Goſpel is called, <hi>A great Salvation which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</hi> Chriſt in his own perſonal preaching is ſaid but <hi>to have begun to teach,</hi> Acts 1.1. and the conſummate publication was the ſending of the holy Ghoſt to theſe Select Veſſels, who were to carry abroad this Treaſure unto all the world; it was begun by the Lord, and it was confirmed by them that were the Diſciples of the Lord. In this reſpect we cannot look on the publiſhing of the Goſpel to the world, but as very glorious; was there not a reſemblance of ſtate and glory in the preaching of Chriſt? You have heard how <hi>a forerunner was ſent to prepare his way,</hi> as an Herald to proclaim his approach, and then was revealed the glory of the Lord; but becauſe the publication was not conſummate
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94897:102"/> till afterwards,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.8.</note> Chriſt carries it on in greater ſtate afterwards than he did before; <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he then led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,</hi> as Princes in time of their ſolemn inauguration do ſome ſpecial Acts of magnificence and Honour; they proclaim Pardons, open Priſons, Create Nobles, fill Conduits with wine; ſo Chriſt to teſtifie the glory of his Goſpel, at the day of his inſtalment, and ſolemn read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into his Fathers glory, he proclaims the Goſpel, gives gifts unto men <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a Prophet he opens and expounds the Goſpel. Thus being in the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day,<note place="margin">Luke 4.17, 18, 21.</note> he <hi>opened the book, and he found the place where it was written, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor, &amp;c.</hi> and then <hi>he cloſed the book—and ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.27.</note> 
                     <hi>this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.</hi> And thus joyning himſelf with two of his Diſciples, going towards <hi>Emmaus, he begun at Moſes, and all the Prophets, and he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf;</hi> the Propheſies of Chriſt were dark and hard to be underſtood, and therefore Chriſt came down from Heaven to diſcover ſuch truths;<note place="margin">John 3.13.</note> 
                     <hi>No man hath aſcended up to Heaven, (i.e.)</hi> to be acquainted with Gods ſecrets, <hi>but he that came down from Heaven;</hi> the gracious purpoſe of God towards loſt mankind, was a ſecret locked up in the breaſt of the Father; and ſo it had been even to this day, had not Chriſt who was in the boſome of the Father, and one of his Privy Council, revealed it unto us; hence Chriſt is called <hi>the Interpreter of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11.27.</note> 
                     <hi>no man knoweth the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> by his interpretation.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.45. Acts 10.14.</note>3. As a Prophet he gives us to underſtand, and to believe the Goſpel. <hi>Then opened he their underſtanding, that they might underſtand the Scriptures;</hi> and thus was the Caſe of <hi>Lydia whoſe heart the Lord opened;</hi> he that firſt opens Scriptures, at laſt opens hearts; <hi>He is that true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.9.</note> he enlightens every believer, not only with a common natural light, but with a ſpecial ſupernatural light, of ſaving, ſpiritual, and effectual knowledge; now there is no Prophet can do this ſave only Jeſus Chriſt, he only is able to cauſe our hearts to believe, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the matter which he doth teach and reveal; other Prophets may plant, and water, <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollo may water,</hi> but he, and only he can <hi>give the increaſe;</hi> other Prophets may <hi>teach and Baptize,</hi> but unleſs Chriſt come in by the powerful preſence of his Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.5. Pſal. 127.1.</note> they can never be able to ſave any one poor ſoul. <hi>We as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter;</hi> but <hi>except the Lord do build this houſe, they labour in vain that build it.</hi> O alas, who is able to breath the Spirit of life into theſe dead ſtones,<note place="margin">John 5.25.</note> but he of whom it is written. <hi>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear it ſhall live?</hi> Who can awaken a dead ſoul out of a dead ſleep? And who can give light unto theſe blind eyes of ours, but he of whom it is written,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Awake thou that ſleepest, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Excellencies of Chriſt above all other Prophets are in theſe reſpects.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Other Prophets were but Types and ſhadows of this great Prophet; even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was but a figure of him;<note place="margin">Acts 7.37.</note> 
                     <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord God raiſe up unto you of your brethren like unto me:</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes;</hi> theſe words, <hi>Like unto me]</hi> do plainly ſhew that <hi>Moſes</hi> was at the beſt but an image and ſhadow of Chriſt; now as ſubſtances do far excel ſhadows, ſo doth Chriſt far excel all the Prophets; they were but ſhadows and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other Prophets revealed but ſome part of Gods will, and only at ſometimes. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in time-paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1.1.</note> 
                     <hi>(i.e.)</hi> he let out his light by little and little, till the Day-ſtar and Sun of Righteouſneſs aroſe;<note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>but in theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken by his Son, (i.e.)</hi> he had ſpoken more fully and plainly; in this reſpect ſaith the Apoſtle, the <hi>heirs</hi> of Life and Salvation were but <hi>children</hi> before Chriſts incarnation.<note place="margin">Gal. 14.1, 2.</note> As now we ſee but through a glaſs darkly, towards what we ſhall do in the life to come; ſo did they of old in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of us; their light in compariſon of ours, was but an obſcure and glimmering light; Chriſts diſcovery of himſelf then was but <hi>a ſtanding behind the wall, a looking forth of the window,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>a ſhewing of himſelf through the lattice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Other Prophets ſpake only to the ears of men, but Chriſt ſpake, and ſtill ſpeaks to the heart;<note place="margin">Revel. 3.7.</note> 
                     <hi>He hath the Keyes of David, that openeth, and no man ſhutteth, that ſhutteth, and no man openeth;</hi> it is a ſimilitude taken from them that keep the Keyes of a City, or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94897:102"/> Caſtle, without whom none can open or ſhut; no more can any man open the heart or break in upon the Spirit, but Chriſt; he only is able to open the eyes of the mind by the ſecret, kindly, and powerful working of his own Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Other Prophets preached wiſdom unto men, but only Chriſt preacheth men wiſe; other Prophets warned men by telling them of their ſins, and denouncing the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, but Chriſt reclaimed them and turned them from ſin; hence it is ſaid, that <hi>he taught as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5.25.</note> it came daily and coldly from them, but it came from him as being full of conviction and reproof,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> full of the <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Other Prophets might not preach themſelves; the Apoſtle inveighs againſt ſelf-commenders, <hi>We dare not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>make our ſelves of the number,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.12.</note> 
                     <hi>or compare our ſelves with ſome that commend themſelves.</hi> Yea, Chriſt himſelf relating to himſelf, as a meer man, ſaith, that <hi>his witneſs is not true if he bear witneſs of himſelf.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5.31.</note> But in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, relating to himſelf as Mediator, he ſpeaks clean contrary,<note place="margin">John 8.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Though I do bear record of my ſelf, yet my record is true.</hi> Here then is a wide difference betwixt other Prophets in reſpect of their Office and Chriſts; they might not preach themſelves, but he bears witneſs of himſelf, becauſe he hath not a greater in the point of our Juſtification, Sanctification, and Salvation, to bear witneſs of them himſelf. And hence are thoſe ſelf-predications of his which we find in Scriptures, as, <hi>Look unto me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 45.22. Mat. 11.28. Luke 24.27.</note> 
                     <hi>and be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth. Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden.</hi> And confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the two Diſciples, it is ſaid, that <hi>beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf.</hi> Surely it commends to us the Propheſie of Chriſt, that he might preach and commend himſelf without any blot of Arrogancy, or taking too much upon him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Other Prophets had their Commiſſion and Authority from him,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.11.</note> 
                     <hi>The words of the wiſe are as goads and as nails faſtened by the Maſters of the Aſſemblies, which are given from one Shepherd, (i.e.)</hi> the words of the wiſe are divine and Heavenly inſtructions; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Aſſemblies are Goſpel-Miniſters, and Chriſt is that one Shepherd from whom theſe words are given, and from whom theſe Maſters have their Authority;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20. Ezek. 20.46.</note> are they not called <hi>Embaſſadours for Chriſt?</hi> and doth not <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tell us, that he muſt <hi>drop his words towards the South?</hi> Now what is the meaning of that <hi>dropping?</hi> It is a phraſe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from rain; as the clouds, from whence the rain deſcends, have not their water Originally and natively in themſelves, but from the Sea; ſo have not the Prophets a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Propheſie of themſelves, but all is drawn up out of Chriſt, as out of a full Sea of all excellent Wiſdom and knowledge. <hi>In him are all the Treaſures,</hi> a Sea, an Ocean of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and from him all the Prophets derived whatſoever they had.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. THe Miracles of Chriſt this year were many; now what were theſe Miracles, but a purſuance of the Doctrines delivered in Chriſts Sermons? One calls them <hi>A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of Chriſts Doctrine, a ſignal of Chriſts Sermons;</hi> If we obſerve, we ſhall find him to work moſt of his Miracles in actions of mercy; indeed once he turned water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wine, and ſometimes he walked upon the waters, but all the reſt were actions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief according to the deſign of God, who would have him manifeſt his power, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy and relief to men.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt all his Miracles done this year, now was it that at <hi>Cana,</hi> where he wrought the firſt Miracle, he does a ſecond; <hi>a certain Noble man,</hi> or Courtier, or little King (as ſome would have it) <hi>came to Jeſus, and beſought him to come down to his houſe,</hi>

                  <p>For the firſt, what they are? Miracles are unuſual events wrought above the courſe or poſſibility of Nature; ſuch were the Miracles of Chriſt, and ſuch were the Miracles of the Prophets, and of the Apoſtles of Chriſt; for what they did was above Nature; and all the difference betwixt their Miracles and the Miracles of Chriſt was only in this, <hi>viz.</hi> they wrought them not in their own Name and Power as Jeſus Chriſt did; Thus when <hi>Eliſha</hi> with twenty loaves and ſome full ears of corn fed an hundred men, <hi>Give unto the people</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that they may eat;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Kings 14.42, 43.</note> 
                     <hi>and his ſervitor ſaid, what ſhould I ſet this before an hundred men? He ſaid again, give the people that they may eat, for thus ſaith Lord, they ſhall eat and ſhall leave thereof.</hi>

                     <hi>Peter ſaid unto him, Aeneas, Jeſus Chriſt maketh thee whole.</hi> And when he cured that man that was lame from his Mothers womb, whom they laid daily at the gate of the Temple,<note place="margin">Acts. 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Silver and gold have I none,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Peter) but ſuch as I have give I thee; in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt of Nazzareth, riſe up, and walk.</hi> But our Saviour comes in an higher ſtrain to the dead damoſel,<note place="margin">Mark 5.41.</note>

                     <hi>Peace, and be ſtill:</hi> and in an higher ſtrain to the raging De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the poſſeſſed, <hi>Be muzzled, and come out of the man.</hi> Heres the difference betwixt the Lord and his ſervants; but in this they agree, their miracles were not <hi>miranda,</hi> but <hi>miracula;</hi> not only wonders, but miracles indeed; they were unuſual events wrought above nature, or the courſe of nature.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, why they are? Many Reaſons are given, of which I hinted before, but in reference to Scriptures, (which is the great controverſie) this is the main and the only true Reaſon; <hi>Miracles are wrought for the grounding or confirming of ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth or doctrine at its firſt ſetling.</hi> To this purpoſe Miracles were as the Trumpets or Heralds, by which the Goſpel was firſt commended unto us; as the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was firſt authorized by manifold Miracles wrought in <hi>Sinai,</hi> and in the Deſert, which afterward ceaſed when they came to, and were ſetled in the promiſed Land; ſo the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt was firſt authorized by manifold Miracles, but the ſound thereof having now gone through all the world, theſe Miracles ceaſe: if new additions of Miracles for the confirmation of Scriptures ſhould be expected in every Age, the former Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles would be ſlighted of all; indeed, Chriſt tells us <hi>of great ſigns and wonders that ſhall be in the laſt dayes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth 24.24.</note> but withall, he tells us of <hi>falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets,</hi> that muſt work them; it may be diſputed, whether thoſe are true miracles, or meer deceptions and magical pretences, but becauſe they are ſuch as the People cannot diſcern them from miracles really ſuch, therefore it is all one as to them; here then is Chriſt's Rule, <hi>Believe them not,—behold I have told you before;</hi> he that foretold us of the man,<note place="margin">Ver. 23, 25.</note> foretold us alſo of the impoſture, and commanded us not to truſt him; in this reſpect it had been more likely for Antichriſt to have prevailed upon Chriſtians by doing no miracles, than by doing any; for if he had done none, he might have eſcaped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovery; but by doing miracles, or wonders, he both verified the Wiſdom and preſcience of Chriſt, and he declared to the Elect that he was the very enemy of Chriſt. As all the Prophets that ſpeak of Chriſt, bade us believe him for his Miracles; ſo all that foretold of Antichriſt, bade us disbelieve him for his Miracles; which occaſioned <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> to ſay,<note place="margin">Contra mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bularios iſtos cautum me fecit Deus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Aug. in Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han. tract. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Againſt ſuch Miracle-mongers God hath armed me to take heed. Go not forth unto ſuch,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.26. and therefore <hi>Brethren ſtand faſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>The great Beaſt deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by means of miracles;</hi> theſe are the words of <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 13.14. but <hi>if any man have an ear let him hear (i.e.)</hi> let him beware, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.9. True miracles that proceed from God, are wrought for the grounding of Doctrine at the firſt ſetling; but being once grounded, and ſetled, and a plat-form deſcribed for the right continuing of it, then we are left to the Scripture, and are not to expect any new miracles for the confirming of it.</p>
                  <p>For the third, whether they are chained and continued in this great tranſaction of our ſouls ſalvation? I anſwer, yea; in this reſpect miracles ceaſe not; it's without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie that Jeſus Chriſt in carrying on our ſouls Salvation is adding miracle to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; there is a chain of miracles in the matter of our ſalvation from firſt to laſt: As.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was a miracle that God in his Eternity, before we had a being, ſhould have once thought of us; eſpecially that the Bleſſed Trinity ſhould ſit in councel, and contrive that moſt admirable and aſtoniſhing plot of the Salvation of our ſouls: Oh what a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was this!</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:94897:104"/>2. It was a Miracle that God for our ſakes ſhould create the world, and after our fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> that God ſhould preſerve the world, eſpecially conſidering that our ſin had unpin'd the whole frame of the Creation; and that God even then ſitting on his Throne of Judgment, ready to paſs the doom of death for our firſt Tranſgreſſion, ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly give a promiſe of a Saviour, when juſtly he might have given us to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and to Hell, according to his own Law,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> 
                     <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was a Miracle that Gods Son ſhould take upon him our nature, and that in our nature he ſhould Tranſact our peace; that he ſhould Preach Salvation to us all if we would believe; and to the end that we might believe, that he would work ſo many ſigns and Miracles in the preſence of his Diſciples, and of a world of men: was not Chriſts Birth a Miracle? and Chriſts Life a Miracle? and Chriſts Death a Miracle? and Chriſts Reſurrection a Miracle? and Chriſts Aſcenſion a Miracle? was not Chriſts Miniſtry a miracle? and was it not a miracle, that Chriſts Word ſhould not be credited without a world of miracles to back it, and confirm it to the Sons of men?<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Without controverſie great is the miracle,</hi> as well as <hi>myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World, received up into glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was a Miracle that God ſhould look upon us in our blood; what a ſight was it for God, when <hi>thy navel was not cut,</hi> when <hi>thou waſt not ſalted at all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.4.5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>nor ſwadled at all</hi> when <hi>thou waſt caſt out in the open field to the loathing of thy perſon?</hi> yet that then, even then the Lord ſhould <hi>paſs by thee, and ſee thee polluted in thy own blood, and ſhould ſay unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live; yea, ſay unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live.</hi> O miracle of mercies! If creation cannot be without a miracle, ſurely the new creature is a miracle indeed. So contrary is our perverſe natures to all poſſibilities of Salvation, that if Salvation had not marched to us all the way in a miracle, we ſhould have periſhed in the ruines of a ſad eternity. Election is a miracle, and Creation is a miracle, and Redemption is a miracle, and Vocation is a miracle; and indeed every man living in the ſtate of grace, is a perpetual miracle; in ſuch a one his reaſon is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into faith, his ſoul into ſpirit, his body iinto a Temple, his earth into heaven, his water into wine, his Averſations from Chriſt into intimate Union with Chriſt; and Adheſions to Chriſt. O what a Chain of Miracles is this? Why <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean;</hi> ſay thus, you that are yet in your blood, why <hi>Lord, if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean. O Lord I believe, help thou my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>After this there was a feaſt of the Jews, and Jeſus went up to Jeruſalem:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5.39</note> Some would have this feaſt to be Pentecoſt; and to ſpeak truly, the moſt of our Commentaries run that way: others take this for the feaſt of the Paſsover, and the rather, becauſe the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> reckons the time of Chriſts publick Miniſtry by the ſeveral Paſsovers; now if this feaſt were not a Paſsover, we cannot find in the Goſpel ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Paſsovers as to make up Chriſts Miniſtry three years and an half. On this ground I joyn with the latter Opinion; and ſo here I end the ſecond year of Chriſts Miniſtry, and come to the third, and to his Actings therein in reference to our ſouls Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</q>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Of Chriſts Ordination of his Apoſtles.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IN the Ordination of his Apoſtles, are many conſiderable things, the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> layes it down thus.<note place="margin">Luke 6.12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>And it came to paſs in thoſe dayes that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God; and when it was day he called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him his Diſciples, and of them he Choſe Twelve, whom alſo he named Apoſtles.</hi> Till now Chriſt taught alone, but becauſe after his Aſcenſion he muſt needs have a Miniſtry till the end of the world, in the firſt place he choſeth out ſome whom he would have on purpoſe to wait upon him all the time of his Miniſtry, till he was taken up into Heaven In this Election, or Ordination, here is firſt the perſon by whom they are Choſen, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. The place were they are choſen, <hi>viz. in a mountain.</hi> 3. The time when they were Choſen, <hi>after his watching and praying all night, and when it was day.</hi> 4. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany out of whom they were Choſen, they where <hi>his Diſciples, and out of them</hi> he makes this Election. 5. The number of them that were Choſen, they <hi>were Twelve,</hi> nor more, nor leſs. 6. The end to which they were choſen, it was to an Apoſtleſhip, <hi>he Choſe Twelve, whom he alſo named Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The perſon by whom they are Choſen is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They Choſe not themſelves, but were choſen of Chriſt; this call was immediate, and therefore moſt excellent; but now we look not after ſuch calls, and therefore I ſhall not inſiſt on that; only by the way, Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt be Miniſters of Chriſt, either immediately, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately called.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The place where they were choſen, it was <hi>on a mountain;</hi> mountainous places have their ſituation neareſt to Heaven; which ſhews that they were called to high and heavenly things: mountains are open and in view, which ſhews their Miniſtry muſt be publick; they cannot lye hid in a mountain, a City that is ſet upon a hill is expoſed to the view of all: Again, mountains are ſubject to Winds and Tempeſts, which ſhew their Callings muſt meet with many oppoſitions; and this occaſioned Chriſt to hold up their hearts with Cordials,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake—for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> The Miniſters of Chriſt are ſure of oppoſition, the <hi>Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the ſervant above his Lord; if they have called the Maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, how much mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> ſhall they call them of his houſhold?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The time when they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> choſen, <hi>when it was, and after he had continued all night in prayer to God;</hi> he goes not to Election, but firſt he watches, and prayes all the night before; this ſhews the ſingular care that Chriſt had in this great employment: what? to ſet men apart to witneſs his Name, and to publiſh to the world the Goſpel of Chriſt? this he would not do without much prayer.<note place="margin">Matth. 14.23.</note> Sometimes we find Chriſt praying alone, as elſewhere,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>He went up into a mountain apart to pray;</hi> and here on this mountain without any of his Diſciples, or Domeſticks about him, he prayes alone; thus, <hi>When thou prayeſt
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94897:105"/> enter into thy cloſet</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we find Chriſt praying at night: <hi>In the daytime he was teaching in the Temple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 21.37</note> 
                     <hi>and at night he went out and abode in the Mount, that is called the mount of Olives:</hi> See Chriſt in the exerciſe of his double Office, he preacheth all day, and prayes all night; this Text tells us, <hi>He continued all night in prayer.</hi> Night prayers have their ſpecial, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantages. 1. It is a time fitter for compunction, and heart-contrition.<note place="margin">Pſal. 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>All the night make I my bed to ſwim, I water my Couch with my Tears.</hi> As ſome things are by heat parched in the day, but cooled in the night; ſo many ſins contracted in the day, are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably repented at night; night tears are as ſweet dews that cool the heat and pride of our ſpirits. 2. It is a time of ſilence and free from diſtraction; then all Tumults ceaſe, and in the ſecret of our ſouls we may ſilently go and ſpeak with our heavenly Father. In this reſpect we have a bleſſed example of Chriſt praying at night, and eſpecially now; O he was about the great work of ſending his Miniſters through all the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now he ſpends all the night long in prayer to his Father; <hi>A great and extraordinary work is not to be ſet upon, without extraordinary prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The company out of whom they are choſen, <hi>He called unto him his diſciples, and out of them he choſe twelve:</hi> A Diſciple of Chriſt is one thing, and an Apoſtle of Chriſt is another thing; thoſe were Chriſts Diſciples that embraced Chriſts Doctrine of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; it was not material to the conſtituting of a Diſciple of Chriſt, whether they followed Chriſt as many did, or they returned to their own homes, as ſome others did. The man out of whom the Legions of devils was caſt,<note place="margin">Luke 8.38, 39.</note> 
                     <hi>beſought Chriſt that he might be with him, but Jeſus ſent him away, ſaying, return to thine own houſe, and ſhew how great things God hath done to thee.</hi> I make no queſtion but Chriſt at the Election of his Apoſtles had many Diſciples both waiting on him, and abſent from him; and out of them that waited on him his Apoſtles were choſen, <hi>Chriſts Miniſters ſhould be firſt Diſciples.</hi> O how unfit are any to take upon them the Miniſtry of Chriſt that were never yet the Diſciples of Chriſt? firſt the grace of God within us, and then muſt that grace of God be diſcovered by us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The number of them that were choſen; they were <hi>Twelve:</hi> very propable it is that there was ſome peculiar reaſon in this account, the number (ſay ſome) was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out to us in many particulars, as in the <hi>Twelve Patriarchs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 35.22. Exod. 15.21.</note> in the Twelve Wells of <hi>Elim,</hi> in the Twelve precious ſtones on the breaſt of the Prieſt, in the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Twelve hours of the day; Chriſt tells them of <hi>ſitting on Twelve Thrones, and judging the Twelve Tribes of Iſrael;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 19.28.</note> but I delight not curiouſly to deſcant on theſe things. This I am ſure, that the doings of Chriſt were done in weight, meaſure, and number.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The end to which they were choſen, it was to an Apoſtleſhip <hi>(i.e.)</hi> that they might be Chriſts Legates to the Sons of men, that they might be ſent up and down the world to perſwade men to Salvation. <hi>The diſpenſers of Gods Word muſt look to their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they muſt not intrude upon ſo ſacred a buſineſs before they are ſent.</hi> Now this miſſion is either extraordinary by immediate inſtinct, and revelation from God, which is ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with immediate and infuſed gifts, and this was the caſe of the Apoſtles; or ordinary, by impoſition of hands and Eccleſiaſtical deſignation: and in this likewiſe is required fidelity, and ability. 1. Fidelity, it is required of Stewards, that a man be found faithful, that he defraud not Chriſt of his purchaſe, which is the ſouls of men, nor men of their price and priviledge, which is the blood of Chriſt; that he watch as a Seer, that he ſpeaks as an Oracle, that he feed as a Shepherd, that he labour as an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, that he be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, to exhort, rebuke, inſtruct, to do the work of an Evangeliſt, to make full proof of his Miniſtry, becauſe he hath an account to make. 2. Ability both for right information of the conſciences of men, and for the ſeaſonable application of truth to particular Circumſtances, which is that which makes a wiſe builder. Ah! <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2 16.</note> How ſhould we but deteſt the preſumption of thoſe men, who run before they be ſent, who leap from their manual trades into this ſacred and dreadful office, unto which heretofore the moſt learned and pious men have trembled to approach?</p>
                  <p>This may inform us of our duty: and this may inform you of your happineſs.<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> 1. Here's our duty; I mean ours of the Miniſtry, Chriſt ordained his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel; and <hi>Paul</hi>'s motto may be ours, <hi>Wo unto me, if I preach not the Goſpel:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.16.</note> 
                     <hi>what though I preach the Goſpel, I have nothing to glory of, for a neceſſity is laid upon me.</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:94897:106"/> This day Chriſt ſent me on this errand,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Go preach, ſaying, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Surely the Lord hath put this meſſage into my mouth, <hi>Repent ſwearers, repent drunkards, repent ſinners, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcoveries are made every day, Chriſt is ariſing and ſhining in our Horizon more and more clearly, that great deſign of Gods love to our ſouls is manifeſted in every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, on every Sabbath: is not this Goſpel-preaching? what is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but <hi>the Treaſure of Gods love in Chriſt opened to us?</hi> Oh it is a pleaſant work in this reſpect to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel to be alwayes ſearching into the Treaſures of love, and to make them known to poor ſouls for the gaining of them unto God. 2. Here is your Happineſs, Chriſt hath not erected any ſtanding Sanctuary, or City of refuge for men to fly to for their Salvation, but he hath appointed Ambaſſadors to carry this Treaſure unto mens houſes, where he invites them, and entreats them, and requires them, and commands them, and compels them to come in. Oh the unſearchable riches of Chriſt! 1. In reſpect of the Meſſengers, 2. In reſpect of their Meſſage.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the Meſſengers; they were firſt Apoſtles; now Miniſters, poor Earthen Veſſels. Had Chriſt himſelf come in his glorified body, attended with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, it might in ſome meaſure have repreſented his Majeſty: but alas! how would this have dazled your weakneſs? or if Chriſt had made uſe of his Angels, as he did at his birth, to preach his Goſpel; had they continually come in ſtate and proclaimed Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sons of men, this would have ſhewed more glory; but alas, how unſuitable had this been to your weak conditions? here then is the riches of his grace, that earthen veſſels ſhould carry this treaſure, that ſalvation ſhould come out of the mouths of ſinful creatures, that hearts ſhould be broken, ſouls ſhould believe, life ſhould be infuſed by the miniſterial breath of a weak worthleſs man;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7.</note> 
                     <hi>We have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us;</hi> Gods power is more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured this way, than if an Angel had come in perſon; it may be in that Caſe a ſinners Converſion would have been attributed to the power and Efficacy of the Angel; but to prevent this, and to preſerve the glory of his power and grace, Chriſt takes the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and he puts it into Earthen Veſſels; it is in the Original <hi>veſſels of ſhell,</hi> as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pearls are found in Shells, ſo the Pearl is the Goſpel, and the Shell or Mother of Pearl are the Apoſtles and Paſtors; it is true, they are Veſſels of ſmall price, and ſubject to many knocks and falls, yet in them is the moſt excellent Treaſures of the Wiſdom of God, and of the Goſpel of Chriſt. And it is in them on purpoſe, that the excellency may reflect on God, and not on them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the Meſſage; O the unſearchable riches of Chriſt! What is the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of theſe men? what is the Treaſure they bring, but the Blood of Chriſt, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel, the Word of Grace? I might ſum up all in one word, <hi>They bring unto men an invitation from heaven, to heaven;</hi> Obſerve it Chriſtians; the Goſpel is a meſſage, the Lord ſends his Son up and down, carries him from place to place; he is ſet forth before mens eyes, he comes, and ſtands, and calls, and Knocks at their doors, and beſeecheth them to be reconciled: O the free grace of God! O that mercy, pardon, preferment, eternal life and Salvation ſhould go a begging, and ſuing for acceptance! O the love of ſin, and madneſs of folly in wicked men, to Trample on ſuch Pearls, and to neglect ſo great Salvation when it is tendered unto them! O what a heavy charge will it be for men at the laſt day, to have the mercy of God, the humility of Chriſt, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the Spirit, the proclamations of pardon, the approaches of Salvation, the dayes, the years, the ages of peace, the Miniſtry of the Word, the Book of God, the great Miſtery of Godlineſs, to riſe up in judgment, and to teſtifie againſt their ſouls? O the condeſcentions of Chriſt! who are ye, that the Lord ſhould ſend after you? what need hath God of you? ſuppoſe you ſhould go on in the wayes of death, and periſh everlaſtingly, what ſhall God loſe by it? Chriſt might ſay, <hi>If you will go on, go on and periſh; if you love ſin ſo well, take your pleaſure in it, and be damned evermore.</hi> Ah no, ſaith the mercy of God, and the mercy of Chriſt, before that be, meſſage after meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.10.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. FOr Chriſt's Reception of ſinners; I cannot limit this only to one year of Chriſt's Miniſtry, but I ſhall only mention it this year. Now this will appear, 1. In the Doctrine of Chriſt. 2. In the Practiſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In his Doctrine, Chriſt layes it down expreſly,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are Heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> It is no more but <hi>come,</hi> and <hi>welcome.</hi> The Goſpel ſhuts none out of Heaven, but thoſe that by unbelief lock the door againſt their own ſouls. Again, <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come unto me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 6.37.</note> 
                     <hi>and him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> here is laid down the full intent and purpoſe of God and Chriſt to pardon and receive ſinners; the Father is willing, and the Son is willing. 1. The Father is willing, <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath ſent me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 6.39.</note> 
                     <hi>that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe none;</hi> the Father is engaged, in that firſt he ſent Chriſt on that errand, to receive ſinners. Secondly, in that he gave unto Chriſt all that he would have to be ſaved by Chriſt, with a charge to loſe none. Sinners were given to Chriſt by his Father as ſo many Jewels to look to, and to ſave. 2. The Son is willing, for <hi>he that cometh unto me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Chriſt is ſo willing to receive ſinners, as that he ſets all his doors open, <hi>he keeps open houſe,</hi> and he caſts out none that will but come in; and why ſo?<note place="margin">John 6.38.</note> 
                     <hi>For I came down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> 1. <hi>I came down from Heaven,</hi> it was a great journey from heaven to earth, and this great journey I undertook for no other purpoſe but to ſave ſinners. Great actions (as one ſayes well) muſt needs have great ends; now this was the greateſt thing that ever was done,<note place="margin">Luke 19.10.</note> that the Son of God ſhould come down from Heaven; and what was the end, but the Reception and Salvation of ſinners? <hi>For the Son of man is come to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt:</hi> had not Chriſt come down, ſinners could not have gone up into Heaven, and therefore that they might aſcend, he deſcends. 2. <hi>I come down from Heaven, not to do mine own will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>but the will of him that ſent me;</hi> his Father had ſent him on purpoſe to receive, and to ſave ſinners; and to this purpoſe, he is called the <hi>Apoſtle of our profeſſion, — who was faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo Moſes was faithful in all his houſe:</hi> His Father could not ſend him on any errand, but he was ſure to do it; his Fathers miſſion was a ſtrong demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that Chriſt was willing to receive thoſe ſinners that would but come to him.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Jeſus ſtood and cryed, ſaying, if any man thirſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 7.37.</note> 
                     <hi>let him come unto me and drink:</hi> the very pith, heart, and marrow of the Goſpel is contained in theſe words: the occaſion of them was thus: on that laſt day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, the Jews were wont with great ſolemnity to draw water out of the fountain of <hi>Siloam,</hi> at the foot of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and to bring it to the Altar, ſinging out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 12.3.</note> 
                     <hi>With joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation;</hi> now Chriſt takes them at this Cuſtom, and recalls them from earthly to heavenly waters, alluding to that of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters.—Incline your ears, and come unto me, and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi> The Father ſaith <hi>come,</hi> the Son ſaith <hi>come,</hi> the Spirit ſaith <hi>come,</hi> yea,<note place="margin">Rev. 22.17.</note> 
                     <hi>the Spirit and the Bride ſay come, and let him that heareth ſay come, and let him that is a thirſt come, and whoſoever will, let him drink of the water of life freely.</hi> All the time of Chriſts Miniſtry we ſee him tyring himſelf in going about from place to place, upon no other errand than this, to cry at the markets, <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters! if any ſinners love life, if any will go to heaven, let them come to me, and I will ſhew them the way to my Fathers boſom, and endear them to my Fathers heart.</hi>

In the acting, exerciſing, and putting forth of his will, how often <hi>would I have gathered thy children together?</hi> The will of Chriſt was ſerious, though not abſolute; I know his divine will abſolutely conſidered could not have been reſiſted; but this was<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> not his abſolute will, but only a will of divine complacency; and ſo he <hi>would not have the death of any, but that all ſhould live;</hi> or he ſpeaks here of his humane miniſterial will (ſay ſome) and not of his divine: many a Sermon had he preached, and many an Exhortation had he dropped, and every Sermon, every Exhortation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his willingneſs, <hi>I would, yea, that I would have gathered thy children together.</hi> 3. In reſemblance of his willingneſs, Chriſt would have gathered <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> children <hi>as the hen gathers her chickens under her wings;</hi> in the metaphor Chriſts care is admirably diſplayed. 1. As the hen with her wings covers the unfeathered chickens. 2. As the hen provides for their food, not eating her ſelf till they are filled. 3. As the hen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends her chickens from the ravenous birds, ſo that to blood ſhe will fight in their defence; ſo hath Chriſts care been for <hi>Jeruſalem. No bird</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtin) expreſſeth ſuch tender love to her young ones as the hen doth;</hi> no fowls ſo diſcover themſelves to be mothers, as hens do; other birds we know to be mothers, when we ſee them in their neſt, but no other way; only the hen diſcovers her ſelf to be a mother, when her chickens do not follow her; for then her feathers ſtand up, her wings hang down, ſhe clocketh mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and goeth feebly; now in reſpect of this ſingular love, Chriſt compares himſelf to an hen; <hi>As an hen gathers her chickens, ſo would I have gathered Jeruſalem.</hi> 4. In that he adds ſo dolefully, <hi>but ye would not;</hi> I would, but ye would not; <hi>q. d.</hi> in me no care ſo great as to ſave your ſouls, in you no care ſo little as your ſouls Salvation; I ſtrove towards you in acts of love, and you ſtrove towards me in acts of ingratitude; I would have done you good, but you would not receive it; <hi>I would,</hi> yea <hi>how often would I? but ye would not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſts reception of ſinners appears yet more in his practiſe. How welcome were all ſorts of ſinners unto him? He caſts out none that acknowledged him for the Meſſiah, he turned none away that gave up their ſouls to be ſaved by him in his own way. This he manifeſts: 1. Parabolically. 2. Really.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Parabolically, eſpecially in thoſe three Parables, of the loſt Groat, and of the loſt Sheep, and of the loſt Son; I ſhall inſtance in this laſt,<note place="margin">Luke 15.20.</note> which may well ſerve for all the reſt.—<hi>When the Prodigal was yet afar off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſſion on him, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi> In theſe words, obſerve, 1. <hi>His Father ſees him</hi> before he ſees his Father; no ſooner a ſinner thinks of Heaven, but the Lord ſpies him and takes notice of him. 2. The Lord ſees him whiles he was yet <hi>a great way off;</hi> he was but in the beginning of his way: his Father might have let him alone till he had come quite home to his houſe, and it had been a ſingular mercy to have bid him welcome then; but he takes notice of him yet <hi>a great way off:</hi> ſinners may be far off from God in their own apprehenſions, and yet the Lord even then draws near, whiles thus they apprehend. 3. His Father had pity or <hi>compaſſion on him;</hi> the Lords bowels even yearn, and work, and ſtir within him at the ſight of his returning prodigals; when <hi>Ephraim had bemoaned himſelf, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 31.18, 19 ver. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>as a bullock unaccoſtomed to the yoak;</hi> why then cries God; <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon? is he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill; therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him ſaith the Lord.</hi>—4. <hi>His Father run:</hi> there is much in this: As, 1. It had been mercy though his Father had ſtood ſtill, till his Son had come. 2. What a mercy is this, that his Father will go, and give his Son the meeting? 3. But above all, oh what abundant mercy call we this, that the Father will not go, but <hi>run?</hi> If he would needs meet his Son, might he not have walked towards him in a ſoft ſlow pace? O no, if a ſinner will but come, or creep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, mercy will not go a foot-pace, but run to meet him; bowels full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94897:108"/> out-pace bowels pinched with hunger; Gods mercy is over all his works, and ſo it is over all our needs, and over all our ſins. 5. He ran, <hi>and fell on his neck; (i.e.)</hi> he hugged and embraced him; O wonder! who would not have been loth to have touched him? was he not in his loathſome ſtinking rags? ſmelt he not of the hogs and ſwine he lately kept? would not ſome dainty ſtomacks have been ready to have caſt all up upon ſuch embracements?<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.6.</note> we ſee mercy is not nice, <hi>When I paſſed by</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I ſaw thee polluted in thy own blood, and I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live; yea, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live;</hi> that very time of her blood, was the time of love; then the Lord <hi>ſpread his Spirit over her, and covered her nakedneſs, and ſwore unto her,</hi>

                     <hi>and he embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him;</hi> before he had thought to have killed him, but now he kiſſed him; its not to tell how dear the Father was to his Prodigal Son, when <hi>he ran, and fell on his neck, and embraced, and kiſſed him.</hi> The ſcope of the Parable is this, that Chriſt is willing and glad to receive ſinners:<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt manifeſts this willingneſs in his practice really; amongſt many inſtances I ſhall inſiſt only on one, a notable inſtance of this year: One of the Phariſees named <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> invited Chriſt to eat with him:<note place="margin">Luke 36.37.</note> into whoſe houſe when he had entred, a certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was a ſinner abiding there in the City, heard of it; a widow ſhe was, and prompted by her wealth and youth to an intemperate life: ſhe came to Jeſus in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees houſe, and no ſooner come, but ſhe layes her burthen at Jeſus's feet, and preſents him with a broken heart,<note place="margin">Ver. 38.</note> and weeping eye, and an Alabaſter Box of Oyntment. <hi>She ſtood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to waſh his feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the hairs of her head; and ſhe kiſſed his feet, and Anointed them with Oyntment.</hi> 1. She <hi>ſtands at his feet,</hi> a ſign of her humility: O what a change! She that was before married to a Noble perſonage, a Native of the Town &amp; Caſtle of <hi>Magdal,</hi> from whence ſhe had her name of <hi>Magdalen;</hi> and ſhe that now was a widow, and therefore took her liberty of pride and luſt, who ſo proud and vile as <hi>Mary Magdalen?</hi> at this time ſhe comes in remorſe and regret for her ſins, and throwing away her former pride, ſhe ſtoops, and waits, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtands at Jeſus feet. 2. She ſtood at his feet <hi>behind him;</hi> a bluſhing ſign of faith; it comprehends in it a Tacite confeſſion of her Sins, ſhe knew her ſelf unworthy of Chriſts preſence; ſhe durſt not look him in the face, but believingly ſhe waits behind him: her ſhame ſpeaks her repentance; and her waiting on him, and not flying from him, beſpeaks her faith. 3. She ſtood at his feet behind him <hi>weeping,</hi> her grief burſt out in tears: ſhe heeds not the feaſt, or feaſter, though uſually they are accompanied with joy, and mirth, and muſick; and ſuch feaſts attended with ſuch vanities ſhe many a time had probably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, yet now ſhe comes in trembling to this feaſt, and falling down before Chriſt, ſhe weeps, and weeps bitterly for her ſins. 4. <hi>She began to waſh his feet with tears;</hi> her tears were not feigned, but fruitful; ſhe wept a ſhower of tears; one conſidering her tears, cries it out, <hi>Terra rigat coelum, the very earth bedews heaven;</hi> her eyes that before were abuſed to luſt, are now fountains of tears; ſhe poures out a flood, great enough to waſh the feet of her bleſſed Jeſus; this was the manner of the Jews, to eat their meat lying down,<note place="margin">John 13.23.</note> and Leaning on their Elbows; or if many eat together, leaning in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of one another; thus at the Paſsover it is ſaid that <hi>there was leaning on Jeſus boſom one of his diſciples whom Jeſus loved;</hi> And in this poſture Jeſus ſitting or lying at meat, <hi>Mary</hi> had the convenience to weep on his feet, which he had caſt behind his fellow; and O how ſhe weeps a main! the Tears ſo Trickle, that ſhe begins to waſh Chriſts feet; ſhe not only waters them,<note place="margin">Jer. 6.1.</note> but waſhes them; that which <hi>Jeremy</hi> wiſhed, <hi>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a Fountain of Tears!

                  </p>
                  <p>I have been long in the proof: but a word of uſe, and I have done. What? is Chriſt moſt willing to receive ſinners? O then be exhorted! who would not come to Jeſus Chriſt? methinks now all ſinners of all ſorts ſhould ſay, though I have been a drunkard, a ſwearer, an unclean perſon, yet now I hear Chriſt is willing to receive ſinners, and therefore I will go to Jeſus Chriſt. This is my exhortation, <hi>O come unto Chriſt, come unto Chriſt!</hi> behold here in the name of the Lord I ſtand, and make invitation to poor ſinners; O will ye not come? how will ye anſwer it at the great day, when it ſhall be ſaid, the Lord Jeſus made a tender and offer of mercy to you, and you would not accept of it? Oh come to Chriſt, and believe on Chriſt; as Chriſt is willing to receive you, ſo be you willing to give up your ſouls to him; the motives to this I may lay down in theſe particulars.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Come unto me,— and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> All the arguments of God and Chriſt, of which you have heard, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chriſt whiles he was upon earth, and the heart of Chriſt now in Heaven; lay theſe together, and apply them to your own ſouls. Oh what work will they make!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The calls of God, and Chriſt; as they are frequent in Scriptures; conſider that Text, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſts, come ye to the waters!</hi> Iſa. 55.1. <hi>[Ho]</hi> he begins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation-wiſe; we uſually ſay, vocations, interjections ſpeak very affectionate motion towards the diſtreſſed; certainly Chriſt's love is a very affectionate love, he layes his mouth to the ears of thoſe that are ſpiritually deaf, and cryes aloud, <hi>Ho [every one]</hi> Chriſt invites all: <hi>As many as ye ſhall find, bid them to the Marriage,</hi> Matth 22.9. As the Heavens are general in their influence, not one graſs on the ground but 'tis bedewed; ſo are Chriſts invitations to his feaſt, not one man in the world but he is invited? <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth]</hi> ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come, and whoſoever will, let him take the water of Life freely,</hi> Revel. 22.17. A thirſt and a will is one and the ſame, it is your will that makes up the match; if you will but ſit down at God's Table, if you will but have the honey-comb with the honey, if you will but drink his Wine with his milk, if you will drink, yea drink abundantly of the flaggons of the new wine of his Kingdom; why then come, <hi>Come ye to the waters; come unto me and drink.</hi> Chriſts arms are ſpread abroad to receive ſinners; he calls and knocks; and calls and waits; and calls and beſeeches; every word here hath ſo much ſweetneſs and dearneſs in it, as it plainly ſpeakes him free and willing to receive you, if you will but come.</p>

Methinks if you had hearts of ſtone, it ſhould melt your hearts; ſurely it is no light matter that makes Chriſt weep; Children weep often, but Wiſe-men ſeldome, yet here the wiſeſt of men weeps for them that would not weep for themſelves; <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  <p>The reaſons of the ſweetneſs, eaſineſs, and pleaſantneſs of Chriſtian Religion, and the practiſe of it, I ſhall reduce into theſe heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſtian Religion is moſt rational. If we ſhould look into the beſt laws that the wiſeſt men in the World ever agreed upon, we ſhall find that Chriſt adopted the quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them all into this one Law; the higheſt pitch of reaſon is but as a ſpark, a taper, a leſſer light, which is involved and ſwallowed up in the Body of this great light, that is made up by the Son of Righteouſneſs. Some obſerve that Chriſt's diſcipline is the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary of all the wiſdom of the Beſt men, and a fair copy and tranſcript of his Fathers wiſdom; there is nothing in the laws of Chriſtian Religion, but what is the perfective of our Spirits, rare expedient of obeying God, and of doing duty and benefit to all capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and orders of men. Indeed the Greeks, whom the World admired for their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom, accounted the Preaching of the Goſpel fooliſhneſs, and thereupon God blaſted their wiſdom, as it is written, <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and will bring to nothing the underſtanding of the Prudent,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.19.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1 19.</note> the Goſpel may be as fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto ſome, but <hi>unto them which are called—Chriſt the Power of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24.</note> 
                     <hi>and the wiſdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſtian Religion hath leſs trouble and ſlavery in it than ſin, or any thing that is contrary to it; as for inſtance; he that propounds to himſelf to live a low, a pious, an humble and retired life, his main imployment is nothing but ſitting Religiouſly quiet, and undiſturbed with variety of impertinent affairs; but he that loves the world entertains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouſand buſineſſes, and every buſineſs hath a world of employments: how eaſie a thing is it to reſtore a pledg? but if a man means to defeat, or to cozen him that truſts him, what a world of arts muſt he uſe to make pretences? as firſt to delay, then to excuſe, then to object, then to intricate the buſineſs, then to quarrel; and all the way to palliate the crime, and to repreſent himſelf an honeſt man: the wayes of ſin are crooked, deſert, rocky, and uneven wayes: the Apocriphal Book of <hi>Solomon</hi> brings in ſuch men, as if in hell they were ſpeaking this language, <hi>We wearied our ſelves in the way of wickedneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wiſd. 5.7.</note> 
                     <hi>yea we have gone through deſerts, where there lay no way; but as for the way of the Lord we have not known it.</hi> Wicked men are in thraldom, but <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.17.</note> 
                     <hi>there is freedom.</hi> O the pains, troubles, expences that men are at to ſerve their ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! ſee how the ambitious man riſeth early, and goes to bed late; ſee how he flatters, diſſembles, ſolicites to obtain nothing but a little wind, a puff, a breath of vain mens mouths! ſee how the covetous man toyls, as if he were tied in a gally by the leg with a chain to ſerve by rowing for ever; ſo I have heard, that <hi>Turks</hi> uſe ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but this is a thouſand times worſe ſervitude, for ſuch a one is in ſervitude to a more baſe Creature than a <hi>Turk,</hi> and he lies bound not only by the feet, but alſo by the hands eares, eyes, heart, and all; only the Chriſtian is at liberty; only Chriſtian Religion and the practiſe of it ſets men at liberty; <hi>If ye continue in my word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 8.31, 32</note> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>then are ye my diſciples indeed, and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſtian Religion is all compoſed of peace; her wayes are the wayes of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all her paths are peace, <hi>Prov</hi> 17.3. Chriſt framed all his Laws in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this deſign of peace; peace within, and peace at home, and peace abroad; 1. It holds forth a certain Heavenly peace, and tranquility within;<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.165. Iſa. 57.20, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> But on the contrary; <hi>The wicked
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94897:110"/> are like the troubled ſea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt; there is no peace ſaith my God to the wicked:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 55.9.</note> their paſſions were never yet mortified; and ſuch paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons uſually range in wicked men as are moſt contrary, and demand contrary thimgs; the deſire of honour cries <hi>ſpend here,</hi> but the paſſion of avarice cries, <hi>hold thy hands;</hi> loſt cries, <hi>venture here;</hi> but pride ſaith, <hi>no ſuch thing, it may turn to thy diſhonor;</hi> anger cries, <hi>revenge thy ſelf here,</hi> but ambition ſayes, <hi>it's better to diſſemble.</hi> And here is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I have ſeen violence and ſtrife in the City;</hi> the vulgar renders it, <hi>I have ſeen iniquity and contradiction in the ſelf-ſame City:</hi> Firſt, Iniquity, for all the demands of theſe paſſions are unjuſt; And, 2. Contradiction, for one paſſion cries out againſt another. But now <hi>great peace have they that love thy Law;</hi> for by the aid of Chriſt and his Grace, their paſſions are in ſome ſort ſubdued: and they paſs on their life moſt ſweetly and calmly, without any perturbations much troubling their Spirits; they have that <hi>Peace which paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> which <hi>the World can neither give nor taſte of, as Chriſt affirmeth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 14.27.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It holds forth peace at home; the Laws of Jeſus teach us how to bear with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitives of our Relatives, and indeed whoſoever obeys the Laws of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he ſeeks with ſweetneſs to remedy all differences, he throws water upon a ſpark, he lives ſweetly with his Wife, affectionately with his Children, deſcreetly with his Servants; and they all look upon him as their Guardian, Friend, and Patron; but look upon an angry man, not ſubject to theſe Chriſtian Laws, and when he enters upon his threſhold, it it gives an alarm to his houſe, every little accident is the matter of a quarrel, and every quarrel diſcompoſes the peace of the houſe, and ſets it on fire, and no man can tell how far it may burn. O the ſweetneſs, eaſineſs, pleaſantneſs of Chriſtian Religion! where that is embraced and followed, the man is peaceable, and charitable, and juſt, and loving, and forbearing, and forgiving; and how ſhould there be but content in this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Family?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It holds out peace abroad, it commands all Offices of kindneſs, gentleneſs, love, meekneſs, humility, lowlineſs of mind towards others; and ſuch ſweet diſpoſitions are uſually received with fondneſs, and all the endearments of the neighbourhood; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes an auſtere, and yet a ſweet deportment; it commands all thoſe labours of love, as to relieve the ſtranger, to viſit the ſick, to waſh the feet of the poor; it ſends us upon charitable embaſſies, to unclean priſons, naſty dungeons, and in the cauſe of Chriſt to lay down our lives one for another; it teacheth us how to return good for evil, kindneſs for injuries, a ſoft anſwer for the rough words of an Enemy; Oh when I think of this, I cannot but think of him who ſaid, That <hi>either that this was not the Chriſtian Religion, or we were not Chriſtians.</hi> For my part I am eaſily perſwaded, that if we would but live according to the diſcipline of Chriſtian Religion, one of thoſe great plagues that vexeth the world (I mean the plague of war) would be no more; certainly this was one of the deſigns of Chriſtianity, that there ſhould be no wars, no jars, no diſcontents amongſt men; and if all men that are called Chriſtians, were indeed charitable, peaceable, juſt, loving, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, what ſweet peace ſhould we have? how would this world be an Image of Heaven, and of the ſociety of Saints and Angels above in Glory?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſtian Religion affords to us all aſſiſtances both outward and inward. In ſome reſpects, I know the duties of Chriſtianity are hard and heavy; but whatſoever Chriſt hath impoſed as heavy and hard, he hath made it light in aids: I ſhall ſhew the helps in theſe particulars. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The holy Scriptures be our helps; this was the very ſcope and aim for which the ſacred Volume was ſent from Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> that we might decline from evil, and do good, that we might die to old <hi>Adam,</hi> and live to Chriſt; that we might crucifie ſin, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Virtue; what are the Scriptures but the Regiſters of God's Will, the letters of God's Love to invite us to Grace, and to dehort us from vice? O the perſwaſion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and commands of God that we might become holy; and O the diſſwaſions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, threatnings, and terrifying of God that we might fly prophaneneſs!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Miniſters of Chriſt be our helps: thou haſt the Scriptures, but it may be thou canſt not read, or thou canſt not underſtand the ſence and meaning thereof; Chriſt therefore for thy help hath ſet up a miniſtry <hi>for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.12.</note> Theſe are the watchmen over the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to cry like trumpets, and to blazon the ſins of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> theſe are the ſuitors of God and Chriſt to ſpeak out his good will in thine ears;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20.</note> they call, they cry, they wait, they woo, they <hi>Pray you in Chriſts ſtead, that you will be reconciled unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:94897:110"/>3. The lives of Saints be our helps; we have not only Teachers in word, but the Saints in all Ages, as ſo many Stars, have given us light how to walk in the darkneſs of this life. The examples of the godly are very drawing, and much for our imitation, and therefore the Pſalmiſt bids us, <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.37.</note> 
                     <hi>for the end of that man is peace.</hi> O it's a bleſſed help to a Chriſtan life to read over, much more to mark, and obſerve the holy and godly lives of the Saints of God; how doth their Zeal condemn our coldneſs, their diligence our negligence, their watching and prayer, our ſluggiſhneſs and indevotion? And how are they as ſpurs to quicken us forwards in our ſpiritual voyage towards Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſts Ordinances be our helpers; as the Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer, and Meditation, and Conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What are they but Fountains of grace, conduits and conveyances of the blood of Chriſt? To what end were they inſtituted, but for the watering of our ſouls to the encreaſe of grace, and to the ſupplanting of ſin and vice, and all manner of evil?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The encouragements of reward be our helps. Now in the practiſe of Chriſtian Religion there is a double reward. 1. The reward of duty,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.11.</note> 
                     <hi>In the keeping of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments there is great reward;</hi> he ſaith not, <hi>for keeping them,</hi> but <hi>in keeping them there is great reward,</hi> there is a grace, a beauty, an excellency in every gracious acting. 2. The reward according to the duty; to this exerciſe of Religion Chriſt hath annexed many ſweet and gracious Promiſes both for this life, and that to come; and theſe Promiſes may be uſed as helps; <hi>He had reſpect unto the recompence of reward.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.26.</note> To this purpoſe are the glorious things of Heaven ſet open before us, that we may have an eye to them, and be encouraged by them. <hi>So run that ye may obtain.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The openings and diſcoveries of the pains of Hell are as helps to reſtrain us from ſin, and to keep us in the way to Chriſt. This, ſome call legal, but Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel tells us of this; in the Goſpel we find a deſcription of hell-pains, ſet out by <hi>weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth; by a worm never dying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 8.12. Mark 9.44.</note> 
                     <hi>and a fire never going out;</hi> Oh when I think of thoſe unquenchable flames, thoſe remedileſs torments, without hope of recovery, remiſſion, or mitigation; when I think of that privation and loſs of the ſight of Gods face, prepared only for thoſe that ſerve him in holineſs, how ſhould I but look about me, and prepare for my reckoning? Nay how eaſie ſhould I think any pains in compariſon? Some perſons in affrightment have been ſeen to carry burthens, and to leap ditches, and climb walls, which their natural power could never have done; and if we underſtood the ſadneſs of a curſed eternity, from which we are commanded to fly, and yet knew how near we are to it, and how likely to fall into it, if we continue in ſin, it would be able to create feares greater than a ſudden fire, or a mid-night alarm.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A principle of love (whereſoever it is planted) is our help; be the Yoak never ſo uneaſie, yet love will make it light;<note place="margin">Can. 3.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> compares the eſtate of the Church to a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and it is deſcribed to have <hi>Pillars of Silver, and a Bottom of Gold, and a Covering of Purple, the midſt thereof being paved with Love;</hi> a ſtrange expreſſion, that the midſt of a Chariot ſhould be paved with love; but 'tis plain, the Chariots wherein Chriſt carries his people up and down in the World, and brings them to himſelf, is ſuch a Chariot as the midſt thereof is paved with love; in this caſe if there were neither Heaven, nor Hell, yet a ſoul would be in the duties of Chriſtianity. I remember how <hi>Ivo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> meeting a grave Matron on the way with fire in one hand, and water in the other, he asked her what thoſe ſymboles meant? and what ſhe meant to do with her fire and water? ſhe anſwered, <hi>My purpoſe is with the fire to burn Paradiſe, and with the water to quench the flames of Hell, that men may ſerve God</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>without the incentives of hope and fear, and purely for the love of God, and Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Surely it was an high expreſſion; for my part I dare not ſeparate thoſe things which God hath joyned together; only this I ſay, that where true love is, there is an excellent help in our way Heaven-wards.</p>

Men, Brethren, and Fathers, if we will but come and cloſe with Chriſt, the Spirit is given to enable us, and Heaven is promiſed to encourage us; the one gives power, and the other ſtirs up our affections, and how then ſhould we complain of preſſure?

                  <p n="1">1. A diſcovery of the beauty of holineſs; when God firſt effectually calls the ſoul home to himſelf, he ſets open the beauty of his ſervice; naturally the heart is poſſeſſed with much prejudice againſt the wayes of Religion, Oh what a ſtrict rule is this to carnal men, to pull out their right eyes, to cut off their right hands, to hate Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Lands, and Life for the Name of Chriſt, to croſs their own deſires, to deny their own ſelves, to mortifie their earthly members, to follow the Lamb through evil report and good report, through afflictions, and perſecutions, and manifold temptations whitherſoever he goeth, to war with principalities, and powers, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places? and hence it is that the Lord is forc'd to ſet forth the wayes of Chriſt as beautiful, even under croſſes and afflictions; thus when the watchman ſmote the Church, and wounded her, and took away her vail, yet ſhe ſtill acknowledged Chriſt (for whoſe ſake ſhe ſuffered) to be <hi>white and ruddy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 5.7, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the faireſt of ten thouſands.</hi> Chriſt ſets forth himſelf and his wayes in all the grace, and goodneſs, and beauty, and ſweetneſs, and lovelineſs that poſſibly may be; <hi>q. d.</hi> by theſe I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure them that belong unto me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An out-bidding of all the temptations of other Lovers; before Chriſt come, ſouls go a whoring from Chriſt, their hearts are allured by other lovers; the world, the fleſh, and the Devil come in, and they proffer Souls ſuch and ſuch contentments; but when Chriſt comes; he deals with ſouls in a more Powerful way, and he out-bids all their former lovers, <hi>q. d.</hi> Did their lovers proffer them comfort? I will bid more comfort; Did their lovers proffer gain? I will bid more gain; Did their lovers proffer honour and reſpect? I will out-bid them in that alſo. And indeed, then hath the Goſpel a true, and full, and gracious work upon the heart, when it yields to the proffers of the Goſpel, as finding that all that the World can bid is now out-bidden; you know, when one comes to offer ſo much for a commodity, and another out-bids him, he carries it away; ſo when the World, and luſt, and ſin proffer to the ſoul ſuch and ſuch contents, then comes Chriſt and out-bids all, and ſo the bargain is made up, and Chriſt carries the heart away; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it may be as yet you feel none of theſe things, but in time you may do, and in the mean time you ſee here is a word for it, <hi>Behold I will allure her,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They object, the Saints themſelves feel no ſuch things, for ought appears to the World; whoſe ſpirits are more heavy and ſad? as it is ſaid of Chriſt himſelf, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laughed, and as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul,</hi>

                     <hi>and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> So it may be ſaid of ſome Chriſtians, if they are ſtrict, that they are ſeldom merry, or pleaſant.—</p>
                  <p>But I anſwer—1. Chriſtians that keep indeed cloſe to the rule, are for the moſt part ſerious, and the word may ſuppoſe them, as ſad.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be they are not in their element, in the acts of Religion, and therefore they cannot expreſs their ſpiritual cheerfulneſs; a fiſh cannot delight it ſelf on the Earth, but when it is in the water; a Bird doth not ſing on the ground, but when it is got up into the air; Gods people cannot rejoyce in ſin, as drunkards and revellers do; but when their hearts are in Religious exerciſes, and in communion with God, they are merry and pleaſant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may be they are in ſuch company as may make them ſad: the men of the World object againſt Saints, that they are heavy, and ſowr, and melancholy men; but in the mean time they conſider not that their ſwearing, revelling, and diſhonouring of God hath made them ſo penſive.

                     <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Of the fourth Year of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Ministry, and generally of his Actings in that Year.</head>
                  <p>THis was the laſt year of Chriſt's miniſtry, in which were thouſands of paſſages: The Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> relates more of Chriſt this year than in all the former; and if I ſtudied not brevity, we might dwell more on his actings for us this year, than hitherto we have done from the beginning of his miniſtry. Now it was that he was tranfigured; now it was that he inſtituted that Sacrament called the Lords Supper; now it was that after ſupper he made his farewell Sermon, rarely mixt of ſadneſs and joyes, and ſtuded with myſteries as with Emeralds; now it was, that after Sermon he bleſſed his Diſciples, and prayed for them, and then having ſung an Hymn, he went out into the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> where in a Garden he began his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. On theſe paſſages I had thought to have enlarged, but I ſee the Book ſwells un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my hands, and now that I am drawing near Chriſt's ſufferings, I ſhall only touch one point, which hitherto I have pretermitted, and is the moſt comprehenſive of any paſſage I can touch.</p>
                  <p>Many Queſtions are about <hi>the Holineſs, or Righteouſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt was bound to obſerve the law of works as a Mediator, or only as a meer man? And whether we are not juſtified by the paſſive Righteouſneſs of Chriſt only? and ſeeing now we are diſcovering Chriſts actings in reference to our ſouls ſalvation, we cannot paſs this main buſineſs, whereof much relates to Chriſt's life, as well as to his conception, or birth, or death, or ſufferings.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Of the diſtinctions, or ſeveral diviſions of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Righteouſneſs.</head>
                  <p>FOr the better underſtanding of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, we uſually diſtinguiſh, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is either that righteouſneſs inherent in him, or performed by him; the righteouſneſs performed by him, is either his fulfilling the Commandments, or his ſatisfying the curſe of the Law. The ſame diſtinction is given by others in theſe terms, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is either his original conformity, or his active and paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the Law: his original conformity, is that gracious inherent diſpoſition in Chriſt from the firſt inſtant of his conception, whereby he was habitually conformable to the Law; and this original righteouſneſs anſwered for our original unrighteouſneſs; his active obedience is his doing of legal obedience unto the command, and his paſſive obedience is his ſuffering of puniſhment due unto us for our ſins.—I ſhall yet a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlarge this diſtinction of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and give it in thus; <hi>viz.</hi> The righteouſneſs of Chriſt is either negative (if I may ſo ſpeak) or poſitive; by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative I underſtand the abſence of all ſins and vices, forbidden in the Law; by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, I mean both a preſence of all vertues, and duties, required to the perfect fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Law, as alſo a voluntary ſuffering of the penalty, to ſatisfie the commination and curſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The negative righteouſneſs is that which we call the innocency of Chriſt: we read often in Scriptures that he was both blameleſs and ſpotleſs. 1. Blameleſs, free in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from all imputation of ſin; to this purpoſe Chriſt challenged the <hi>Jews: Which of you convinceth me of ſin?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 8.46.</note> In all his life he was unblameable and unreproveable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now towards the end of his life he asks the people with whom he had converſed, <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.19. Heb. 7.26.</note> Spotleſs, free from all infection of ſin; <hi>Peter</hi> calls him a <hi>Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot;</hi> and <hi>Paul, an high Prieſt, Holy, Harmleſs, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled;</hi>

The poſitive Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is twofold, his perfect fulfilling of all things commanded, and his perfect ſatisfying of the puniſhment threatned: The former is the holineſs of Chriſt; this alſo is twofold, the holineſs of his nature, and the holineſs of his life and converſation; the former is that we call his habitual Righteouſneſs, the latter is that we call his actual obedience. And thus much of the diſtinction of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>NOw in the firſt place, for the holineſs of his Nature, the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Thou art fairer than the Children of men, and grace is poured into thy lips.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.2.</note> Which is all one with that deſcription of Chriſt by the Spouſe, <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 5.10.</note> 
                     <hi>the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of ten thouſands.</hi> As in the faireſt beauty, there is a mixture of theſe two colours, <hi>white and ruddy,</hi> ſo in Chriſt there is a gracious mixture, and compound of all the graces of the Spirit; there is in him a ſweet temper of gentleneſs, purity, righteouſneſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility; and what not? <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of Wiſdom, and Knowledge;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.3.</note> and I may add, of all other gifts and graces; not a grace but it was in Chriſt, and that in an higher way than in any Saint in the World; and therefore he is called <hi>fairer than all the children of men.</hi> Obſerve, <hi>There was more habitual grace in Chriſt than ever was, or is, or ſhall be in all the Elect, whether Angels or Men.</hi> He received the Spirit out of meaſure; there was in him as much as poſſibly could be in a creature, and more than in all other creatures whatſoever. As the Sun is the Prince of Stars, as the Husband is the head of the Wife, as a Lion is the King of the Beaſts, ſo is this Sun of Righteouſneſs, this Head of the Church, this Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah, the chiefeſt of ten thouſands;</hi> if we look at any thing in Heaven or Earth, that we obſerve as eminently fair, by that is the Lord Jeſus in reſpect of his inward beauty ſet forth in Scriptures, he is <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs, the bright Morning-Star, the Light of the World, the Tree of Life, the Lilly and the Roſe;</hi> fairer than all the Flowers of the Field, than all the precious Stones of the Earth, than all the Lights in the Firmament, than all the Saints and Angels in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, What's all this to us; Certainly much every way; the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>That the Law of the Spirit of Life which is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> 
                     <hi>hath freed me from the Law of ſin &amp; of Death;</hi> let us enquire into theſe words, <hi>the law of the Spirit of life;] the Spirit of life</hi> is here put for <hi>life,</hi> as elſe where, <hi>After three dayes &amp; an half,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 11.11.</note> 
                     <hi>the Spirit of life coming from God ſhall enter into them.</hi> Now life is that whereby a thing acteth and moveth it ſelf, and it is the cauſe and beginning of action and motion: and this <hi>Spirit of life,</hi> or <hi>life</hi> it ſelf, being here applied to Chriſt, it is that in Chriſt which is the beginning and cauſe of all his holy actions; and what was that but his Original holineſs, or the holineſs of his humane Nature? But why is the holineſs of Chriſts nature called <hi>the Spirit of life?</hi> I anſwer, 1. Becauſe it was infuſed into his manhood by the Spirit of God, <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee—therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1.35.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> 2. Becauſe it is a moſt exact, and abſolute, and perfect holineſs; the Scripture-phraſe ſetting out things in perfection or fulneſs, uſually adds the word <hi>Spirit</hi> unto them; as the ſpirit of pride, the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of error; ſo then the meaning of <hi>the Spirit of life</hi> is all one with the moſt abſolute and moſt perfect purity, and holineſs of the nature of Chriſt. It is briefly, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>the law of the Spirit of life,</hi> or the power of the moſt abſolute and perfect holineſs of the nature of Chriſt, <hi>hath freed me from the law of ſin and death;</hi> hath acquitted me from the power of my ſinful nature, and from the power of death due to me in reſpect of my ſinful and corrupt nature. We might draw from hence this concluſion, that—<hi>The benefit of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>habitual righteouſneſs infuſed at his firſt conception, is imputed to believers to their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> As the obedience of his life, and the merit of his death, ſo the Holyneſs infuſed at his very conception, hath its influence into our juſtification: it is by the obedience of his life that we are accounted actually holy, and by the purity of his conception (or habitual grace) that we are accounted perſonally holy. But I muſt not ſtay here; Thus much of the Holineſs of Chriſt's Nature.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note>2. FOr the holineſs of Chriſts life, the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>by the obedience of one many ſhall be made righteous;</hi> here's the obedience of Chriſt, and its influence on us. 1. The obedience of Chriſt is that whereby he continued in all things written in the book of the Law to do them:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.17. John 8.29. Acts 3.14.</note> Obſerve, <hi>Chriſt's life was a viſible commentary on Gods Law,</hi> For proof, <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law, or the Prophets</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but to fulfil them.</hi> And, <hi>the Father hath not left me alone</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for I do alwayes thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> Hence Chriſt in Scripture is called <hi>Holy and Juſt,</hi> and <hi>the Holy One,</hi> Acts 2.27. <hi>The moſt Holy,</hi> Dan. 9.24. by his actual holineſs Chriſt fulfilled in act every branch of the Law of God; he walked in all the Commandments of God; he performed perfectly both in thought, word, and deed whatſoever the Law of the Lord required.—I do not, cannot limit this obedience of Chriſt to this laſt year of his Miniſtry, for his whole life was a perpetual courſe of obedience, he was obedient unto death,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>even until his death;</hi> and yet becauſe we read moſt of his holy actings this year, and that this was the year wherein both his active and paſſive obedience did moſt eminently ſhine, and break forth; the year wherein he drew up all the diſperſions of his precepts, and caſt them into actions, as into ſums total; therefore now I handle it, and I ſhall make it out by the paſſages following, only in this one year. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now he diſcovered his charity in feeding the hungry, as at once five thouſand men with five Loaves and two Fiſhes, <hi>John</hi> 6.9, 10, 11.<note place="margin">John 6.9, 10, 11.</note> and at another time four thouſand men with ſeven Loaves, and a few ſmall Fiſhes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.32.<note place="margin">Matth. 15.32.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now he diſcovered his ſelf-denial, and contempt of the World, in flying the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of a Kingdom; when the people were convinc'd that he was the Meſſiah from that miracle of feeding five thouſand men with five Loaves, preſently they would needs make him a King; but he that left his Fathers Kingdom for us, he fled from the offers of a Crown and Kingdom from them,<note place="margin">John 6.15.</note> as from an enemy, <hi>When Jeſus perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a King, he departed again into a Mountain himſelf alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now he diſcovered his mercy, in healing the Womans Daughter that had an unclean ſpirit;<note place="margin">Mar. 7.26, 27.</note> the Woman was a Greek, a <hi>Syrophenician by Nation;</hi> and in that reſpect Chriſt called her <hi>a Dog,</hi> and yet Chriſt gave her the deſire of her ſoul: O the rich mercy of Chriſt, that he would admit a Dog to his Kingdom! O grace! O mercy! that Chriſt ſhould black his fair hands in waſhing foul and defiled Dogs! what a motion of free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was this, that Chriſt ſhould lay his fair, ſpotleſs, and chaſt love, upon the black, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and whoriſh ſouls? O what a favour, that Chriſt maketh the Leopard and Ethiopian white for Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 16.19.</note>4. Now he diſcovered his bounty, in giving the <hi>Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> to his Apoſtles, and to their Succeſſors; this was a power which he had never communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before; it was a gift greater than the great Charter of Nature, and the Donative of the whole Creation. Indeed at firſt God gave unto man a <hi>dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> 
                     <hi>and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattel, and over the Earth; but till now Heaven it ſelf</hi> was never ſubordinate to humane Miniſtration; herein was the acting of Chriſt's bounty, he gives unto his Miniſters the Keys of Heaven, that <hi>Whatſoever they ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever they ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now he diſcovered his patience, in ſuffering all injuries; from hence forward to the death of Jeſus, we muſt reckon his dayes like the Vigils, or Eves of his Paſſion; for now he began, and often did ingeminate thoſe ſad predictions of the uſage he ſhould ſhortly find,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.21.</note> that he ſhould be <hi>rejected of the Elders, and chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and ſuffer many things at Jeruſalem, and be killed, and be raiſed up the third day,</hi> and in the mean time he ſuffers both in word and deed; they call him a Glutton, a Drunkard, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, a Sinner, a Mad-Man, a Samaritan, and one poſſed with a Devil; ſometimes they take up ſtones to ſtone him, and ſometimes they lead him to an Hill, thinking to throw him down headlong, and all this he ſuffereth with patience; yea with much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he poſſeſſeth his ſoul.</p>

                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:94897:114"/>6. Now he diſcovered his glory, in being transfigured on the Mount; however the Perſon of Chriſt was uſually depreſſed with poverty, diſgrace, ignominy; ſo that neither Jews nor Gentiles, nor the Apoſtles themſelves could at firſt diſcern the brightneſs of his Divinity; yet now Chriſt gave an excellent probation of that great Glory, which in due time muſt be revealed to all the Saints; <hi>For taking with him Peter, James and John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 9.28, 29, 30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>he went up into the Mountain to pray, and while he prayed, he was transfigured before them, and his face did ſhine like the Sun, and his garments were white and gliſtering, and there appeared talking with him Moſes and Elias, ſpeaking of the deceaſe which he ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh at Jeruſalem;</hi> the embaſſie of Chriſts death was delivered in forms of Glory, that ſo the excellency of the reward might be repreſented together with the ſharpneſs of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Now if ever, whiles he was upon Earth, was the beauty of Chriſt ſeen at height, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw it; and was ſo raviſhed at the ſight, that he talked he knew not what. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this glorious beauty, his face is ſaid to <hi>ſhine like the Sun.</hi> I cannot think, but his ſhine exceeded Sun, and Moon, and Stars; but the Sun is the brighteſt thing we know, and therefore it is ſpoken to our capacity; Here's one ſtrain of exaltation, though moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Chriſt's life was a ſtate of humiliation; it learns us to be content with, yea to expect moſt humiliation, little exaltation here; we may have a taſte, but no continued comforts till we come to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now he diſcovered his meekneſs <hi>in riding upon an Aſs, and a colt the foal of an Aſs;</hi> which was according to the Propheſie, <hi>Behold thy King cometh unto thee meek;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 21.5.</note> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in rebuking the furious, intemperate zeal of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who would fain have called for fire from Heaven to have conſumed the Inhabitants of a little Village, who refuſed to give Chriſt entertainment. Ah, ſaith Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 9.55.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye know not of what ſpirits ye are of: q. d.</hi> you muſt learn to diſtinguiſh the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, from the ſpirit of <hi>Elias;</hi> why, <hi>Chriſt came with a purpoſe to ſeek and to ſave mens lives,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 56.</note> 
                     <hi>and not to deſtroy them:</hi> it were raſhneſs indeed to ſlay a man on ſome light diſpleaſure, whoſe redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on coſt the effuſion of the deareſt heart-blood of the Son of God. See here the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the fury and anger of his own Diſciples.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now he diſcovered his pity and compaſſion, in weeping over <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 19.41, 42.</note> 
                     <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, ſaying, if thou hadſt known, even thou, &amp;c.</hi> We read of <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 43.30. Gen. 45.1.</note> that there was in him ſuch a brotherly and natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, that <hi>his bowels yearned upon his Brethren,</hi> and <hi>he could not refrain himſelf before all them that ſtood by him:</hi> his love was like an hot Furnace: now Jeſus Chriſt hath the ſame heart and bowels of a man; and I conceive as Chriſt was a man void of ſin, ſo the acts of natural vertues (as to pity the afflicted, to compaſſionate the diſtreſſed) were ſtronger in him than poſſibly they could be in any other man; ſin blunteth natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, eſpecially ſuch as incline to laudable and good acts, as to love, and pity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, the miſerable; in this reſpect <hi>Joſeph</hi> was nothing to Chriſt; when Chriſt ſaw <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he wept, and wept; his compaſſion ſtrangled, and encloſed within him, it muſt needs break out; it may be in ſome meaſure it eaſed Chriſt's mind, that his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercy found a vent; we read that pity kept within Gods bowels, pains his very heart; ſo that it muſt needs come out, <hi>Mine heart is turned within me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11.8.</note> 
                     <hi>my repentings are kindled together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now he diſcovered his humility, in waſhing his Diſciples feet; <hi>Supper being ended,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 13.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>he laid aſide his garments, and took a towel, and girded himſelf, and poured water into a baſon, and began to waſh his Diſciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</hi> In this ceremony, and in the diſcourſes following he inſtructs them in the Doctrine of humility; yea, he imprints the leſſon in laſting Characters, by making it ſymbolical. But why would he waſh their feet, rather than their hands, or heads? I anſwer, it is probable on this account, that he might have the opportunity of a more humble poſture. See how he layes every thing aſide, that he might ſerve his ſervants; Heaven ſtoops to Earth, on abiſs calls one another, the miſeries of man which were next to infinite, are excelled by a mercy equal to the immenſity of God. It is ſtoried of one <hi>Guericus,</hi> that upon the conſideration of this humility of Chriſt in waſhing his Diſciples feet, he cried out, <hi>Thou haſt overcome me, O Lord, thou haſt overcome my pride, this example hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered me.</hi>

                  <p>Againſt this are divers exceptions of the Adverſaries. As, 1. That the Law is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied either by doing that which is commanded, or by ſufferring the puniſhment which is threatned. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true in reſpect of the penal Statutes of men, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Commandments of God, in which there is not only a penalty threatned, but a bleſſedneſs promiſed: if man had continued in his integrity, the Law might have been ſatisfied by obedience only; but being fallen into a ſtate of diſobedience, two things are neceſſarily required to the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the bearing of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and the performing of the Command; the one to eſcape Hell, and the other to obtain Heaven. 2. They except that whoſoever are freed from Hell, are alſo admitted to Heaven. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſon thereof is becauſe Chriſt who did bear the puniſhment to free us from Hell, did alſo fulfil the Commands to bring us to Heaven; but howſoever theſe two benefits of Chriſt do alwayes concur in the party juſtified, as the cauſes thereof concurred in Chriſt, who not only did both obey and ſuffer, but in obeying ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and in ſuffering obeyed; yet both the cauſes between themſelves, and the effects between themſelves, are carefully to be diſtinguiſhed; for as it is one thing to obey the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94897:115"/> Commandment, and another thing to ſuffer the puniſhment; ſo it is one thing to be freed from Hell by Chriſt his ſuffering the penalty, and another thing to be intitled to Heaven, by Chriſt his fulfilling the Commandments. 3. They except, that God is a moſt free Agent, and therefore he may if he will, juſtifie men by the paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt only, without fulfilling of the Law. <hi>Anſw.</hi> What God may do, if he will, I will not diſpute; but ſure I am, that he juſtifieth men according to his will revealed in his Word; and there we find, that as we are juſtified from our ſins by the Blood of Chriſt, ſo alſo we are made juſt by the active (though not only by the active) obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt; <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> And <hi>if when we were enemies,</hi>

And herein ſtands both the agreement and difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpel; the agreement, in that both require the perfect fulfilling of the Law unto juſtification; the difference, in that the Law requireth perfect obedience to be performed in our own perſons; but the Goſpel accepts of perfect obedience perfomed by Chriſt our ſurety, and imputed to us; and ſo it is all one as if it had been performed in our own perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Chriſt by his conformity to the Law fulfilled the Law for us, then are we juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his habitual and actual righteouſneſs, and not meerly by his paſſive; but Chriſt by his conformity to the Law, fulfilled the Law for us; for ſo we read, <hi>He was born for us,</hi> Luke 2.11.<note place="margin">Luke 2.11.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Againſt this are divers exceptions: As, 1. That Chriſt obeyed the Law, or conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Law (as need was) for himſelf, <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>as he was a man, was bound to obey the Law for himſelf.

From his merit, for if his obedience were of duty, then it were not<note n="†" place="margin">Debitum non eſt meritum.</note> meritorious, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. and if this be true, then have we no title to Heaven. 2. From the dignity of his Perſon, as if he needed either to obey for himſelf, or by his obedience were any way bettered in himſelf. O that theſe men would remember that the Perſon who did obey the Law was, and is, not only man, but God alſo; Chriſt fulfilled the Law not only as man, but as God-man, Mediator; and therefore as his blood was <hi>Gods blood,</hi> ſo his obedience was the obedience of God, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God—And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 20.28. Phil. 2.6, 8.</note> or <hi>until death.</hi> We find him here God-man; and from hence we conclude, that all the legal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt from his Incarnation to his Paſſion incluſively, were the actions of Chriſt God-man, Mediator, and Surety for us in a way of covenant; and conſequently they were not performed of duty, nor for himſelf. 2. They except, that if Chriſt obeyed the Law for us, that by his obedience we might be juſtified, then ſhall not we our ſelves need to obey the Law; but the Conſequent is abſurd, therefore the Antecedent. <hi>Anſw.</hi> We need not to obey the Law to that end, that we may be juſtified thereby, for this is impoſſible to us by reaſon of the fleſh, and therefore our Saviour fulfilled it for us; and yet it follows not but that we may endeavour to obey the Law for other ends; as to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, to obey his Will, to teſtifie our thankfulneſs, to edifie our Brethren, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelves of our juſtification, and ſo to make our calling and election ſure: in this Study and Practice of Piety conſiſteth our new obedience, which we muſt therefore be careful to perform, though Chriſt as to juſtification hath performed it for us. 3. They except, that if Chriſt by his active obedience fulfilled the Law for us, and that ſo we are
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94897:116"/> juſtified from all kind of ſin both original and actual, then Chriſt's ſuffering was in vain. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt's active obedience is an eſſential part of our juſtification, but not all our juſtification; the material cauſe of our juſtification is the whole courſe of the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, together with his original righteouſneſs, or habitual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto the Law; I ſay <hi>together with his original righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors expreſs no more, but only Chriſt's active and paſſive obedience; but they are to be underſtood, as aſſerting his original righteouſneſs implicitely, the act preſuppoſing the habit. And here obſerve the difference betwixt the Law in caſe of innocency, and the Law in caſe of ſin; the Law in caſe of innocency required only doing, but the Law in caſe of ſin cannot be ſatisfied without doing and ſuffering, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Original juſtice and active obedience was ſufficient to juſtifie man in his innocency, but not to juſtifie man fallen; and therefore we do not ſeparate theſe, the original, the actual, and the paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as to the matter of juſtification, but we imply all.</p>

We read in Scripture of two parts of juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> the abſolving of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſinner from the guilt of ſin, and death; and the accepting of a believing ſinner as righteous unto life. The former is wrought by the ſufferings of Chriſt imputed as a full ſatisfaction for ſin, the other by imputation of Chriſt's perfect obedience, as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient merit of eternal life; by the former we are freed from Hell, by the latter we are entitled to the Kingdom of Heaven,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.9, 19.</note> of them both the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>We are juſtified by his blood,</hi> Rom. 5.9. and we <hi>are made righteous by his obedience,</hi> Rom. 5.19.— Our Adverſaries deny theſe two parts of juſtification, ſaying that it conſiſts wholly in remiſſion of ſin. But we reply in every mutation, though it be but relative, we muſt of neceſſity acknowledge two terms, <hi>terminum a quo, &amp; terminum ad quem,</hi> the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination being commonly taken from the latter: as in juſtification there is a motion or mutation from ſin to juſtice, (from which term juſtification hath its name) from a ſtate of death and damnation, to a ſtate of life and ſalvation; but if juſtification be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but bare remiſſion of ſins, then is there in it only a not imputing of ſin, but no acceptation as righteous; a freedom from Hell, but no title to Heaven.—They ſay indeed, that to whom ſin is not imputed, to them righteouſneſs is imputed; and we grant that theſe things do alwayes concurr; but yet they are not to be confounded, for they differ in themſelves, and in their cauſes, and in their effects. 1. In themſelves; for it is one thing to be acquitted from the guilt of ſin, and another thing to be made righteous, as we ſee daily in the pardon of Malefactors. 2. In their cauſes, for the remiſſion of ſin is to be attributed to Chriſt's ſatisfactory ſufferings, and acceptation as righteous unto life to Chriſt's meritorious obedience. 3. In their effects, for by remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin we are freed from Hell, and by imputation of Chriſt's obedience we have right unto Heaven. I will not deny but that to Chriſt's habitual and actual righteouſneſs is ſometimes attributed freedom from Sin and Hell, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> 
                     <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death;</hi> and on the contrary ſide to Chrſt's paſſive obedience is ſometimes attributed a right unto Heaven, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.15.</note> 
                     <hi>That by means of his death,—they which are called might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternal inheritance;</hi> but ſuch places as theſe, are to be underſtood by a <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> which puts only one part of Chriſt's obedience for the whole obedience of Chriſt.

Conſider the Preaching of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> we talk of ſtrictneſs, but ſhew me among all the Miniſters or Saints of this Age, ſuch a pattern of ſanctity and ſingular auſterity; the ſum of his ſermons was <hi>repentance, and dereliction of Sin, and bringeth forth fruits worthy of amendment of life.</hi> In the promoting of which Doctrine, he was a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehender of the Phariſees, and Saduces, and Publicans, and Souldiers, and indeed of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that remained in their impenitency; for againſt them he denounced judgment, and fire unquenchable; Oh, he had an excellent zeal, and a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Spirit in Preaching; and the Commentary upon all his Sermons was his own life; he was cloathed in Camels hair, his meat was locuſts and wild honey; he contemned the world, reſiſted temptations, deſpiſed to aſſume falſe honours to himſelf, and in all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages was a rare example of ſelf-denial, and mortification; and by this means he made an excellent, and apt preparation for the Lord's coming.

Conſider of the Baptiſm of Chriſt; he that never ſinned was made ſin for us, and ſo it was proper enough for Chriſt to take upon him the Sacrament of ſinners, or of repentance for ſin; but eſpecially he was baptiſed, that in the ſymbole he might purifie our nature, whoſe ſtains and guilt he had undertaken. Conſider of this, O my ſoul, and bring it home to thy ſelf, ſurely every ſoul that lives the life of Grace, <hi>is born of water, and the Spirit:</hi> and to this purpoſe Chriſt, who is our life, went down into the waters of Baptiſm, that we who deſcend after him might find the effects of it; as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin; adoption into the Covenant of Grace, and holineſs of life. Had not Chriſt been Baptiſed, what vertue had there been in our Baptiſm? As <hi>it became him to fulfil all righteouſneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 3.15.</note> and therefore he muſt needs be baptized; ſo he fulfilled it not for himſelf, but for us; Chriſt's obedience in fulfilling the Law, is imputed to all that believe unto righteouſneſs, as if themſelves had fulfilled; ſo that he was Baptized for us, and the vertue of his Baptiſm is derived unto us; O the ſweet of this medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Chriſt was Baptized; and when Baptized, the <hi>Heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcended,</hi> and a voice from Heaven proclaimed him to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and

O my ſoul! what a bleſſing is there in the Baptiſm of Chriſt? and how mayeſt thou ſuck and be ſatisfied, if thou wilt put thy meditation to the right uſe? the Baptiſm of Chriſt is as a field of flowers, wherein is a world of priviledges, as juſtification, adoption, regeneration, ſanctification, glorification; O then fix thy ſoul at leaſt on ſome of theſe flowers, and leave them not without carrying ſome honey away with thee; if thou art in Chriſt thou art Baptiſed into his death, and Baptized into his Baptiſm; thou partakeſt of the fruit and efficacy both of his death and life, and baptiſm, and all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Conſider the faſting and temptation of Chriſt in the Wilderneſs. Now we ſee what manner of adverſary we have, how he fights, how he is reſiſted, how overcome; in one aſſault Sathan moves Chriſt to doubt of his Fathers providence; in another to preſume on his Fathers protection, and when neither diffidence nor preſumption can fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten upon Chriſt, he ſhall be tryed with honour: and thus he deales with us; if he cannot drive us down to deſpair, he labours to lift us up to preſumption, and if neither of theſe prevail, then he brings out pleaſures, profits, honours, temptations on the right hand, which are indeed moſt dangerous: O my ſoul, whilſt thou art in this warfare, here's thy condition; temptations, like waves, break one in the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if the devil was ſo buſie with Chriſt, how ſhouldſt thou hope to be free? how mayeſt thou account, that the repulſe of one temptation will but invite to another? well, but here's thy comfort, thou haſt ſuch a Saviour <hi>as was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſin;</hi>

                     <hi>how boldly therefore mayſt thou go to the Throne of Grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy, and to find grace of help in time of need?</hi> Chriſt was tempted, that he might ſuccour them that are tempted, never art thou tempted O my ſoul, but Chriſt is with thee in the temptation; he hath ſent his Spirit into thy heart to make interceſſion for thee there, and he himſelf is in Heaven, making interceſſion, and praying for thee there; yea his own experience of temptations hath ſo wrought it in his heart, that his love and mercy is moſt of all at work when thou art tempted moſt. As dear parents are ever tender of their Children, but then eſpecially when they are ſick, and weak, and out of frame; ſo though Chriſt be alwayes tender of his People, yet then eſpecially when their ſouls are ſick, and under a temptation; O then his bowels yearn over them indeed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Conſider Chriſts firſt manifeſtations by his ſeveral Witneſſes; we have heard of his Witneſſes from Heaven, the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; and of his Witneſſes on Earth, the Baptiſt, his Diſciples, and the works that he did in his Fathers Name? and all theſe Witneſſes being lively held forth in the preaching of the Goſpel, they are Witneſſes to us; even to this day is Chriſt manifeſted to us, yea and if we are Chriſts, even to this day is Chriſt manifeſted within us.

                  <p n="5">5. Conſider <hi>Chriſts</hi> whipping the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple. Sometimes O my ſoul, thou art in ſecret; and ſometimes thou art in the Aſſemblies of Gods people; and if thou art in duty, whereſoever thou art, conſider the eſpecial preſence of Chriſt; and what is that but the preſence of his Spirit, and the preſence of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? 1. The preſence of his Spirit; this we know by his working in us, certainly the Spirit doth not only hover over us, but worketh in us: How in us? I anſwer by his quickning, feeding, cheriſhing, healing, mollifying, melting, comforting. In this manner he works in us when we are in Ordinances. Why now is he (I hope) riding with triumph in the midſt of the Aſſembly, now is he in his Chariot, in his Throne, in the hearts of his people, and therefore away, away with all buyers and ſellers, out of that Temple of the holy Ghoſt. —2. The Preſence of Chriſt is the preſence of his Angels; as a King is where his Court is, ſo is Chriſt the King of Kings eſpecially preſent where his bleſſed Angels pitch their Tents. And the preſence of Angels is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy (O my ſoul) of thy conſideration. Certainly they are miniſtring Spirits, that have a work to do upon thy inward man; I grant the Spirit of Chriſt can only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the underſtanding, and determine the will effectually; it is he only can bend, and turn, and form the mind which way ſoever he pleaſeth; but the Angels can ſpeak alſo to thy ſpiritual parts, and though the ſpirit only determine, yet their ſpeaking carries a Power with it.</p>
                  <p>By way of digreſſion, it is a fine skill to know how the Angels can ſpeak to us, and how we may know when they ſpeak; and how we may diſcern what is ſpoken by the immediate inſpiration of the ſpirit, and what by the mediation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How do the Angels ſpeak to us? We muſt conceive if we underſtand this, firſt that the Images, or phantaſms of things received by the outward ſenſes, are kept, and preſerved by the inward ſenſes, as the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of ſounds, of ſhapes, or whatſoever elſe. 2. That the images phantaſms ſo kept, may be ſo moved by our ſpirits, or humours, or ſome extrinſecal things, as that they may move the fancy, and provoke it to repreſent, and conceive ſuch things as neither appear, nor are at that time perceived by any outward ſence at all. This appears, 1. In our ordinary courſe, as we can ſit in the dark, where we hear and ſee nothing, and yet there we can multiply a fancy in <hi>infinitum,</hi> by an act of our own Will. 2. This appears in our dreams, when though we hear or ſee nothing, yet the humour can ſtir up the memory of things, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke our fancies to the apprehenſion of this or that. 3. This appears alſo in ſickneſs, which altering the body, and the humours, and ſo troubling the fancy, it begets ſtrange fancies, and makes dreadful and fearfull repreſentations unto us: now this we muſt know, that whatſoever an inferiour Power can do, that a ſuperiour Power can do much more; whatſoever an act of our own Will, or natural Dreams, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural ſickneſs can do, that the Angels can do moſt orderly, and efficaciouſly; they know exactly how the Spirits and humors muſt be moved, that the images or phantaſms may be applyed to ſuch and ſuch conceptions or apprehenſions, moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and fitted for the knowledg of what truth they would ſuggeſt. So that to me here is the difference between the converſe of Men and Angels; Men can ſpeak to our underſtandings by the mediation of our external ſenſes, but Angels go a nearer way to work, and ſpeak to the internals firſt of all: they do no more but come into the memory (the treaſurer of all our phantaſms and imaginations) and there make ſuch and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions even as they pleaſe, and then the underſtanding takes them off, and reads what is written, without more ado.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How may we know when the Angels ſpeak to us? I confeſs it is an hard queſtion, and eaſily it cannot be ſolved; only ſome conjecture we may have; as in a caſe of evil; thou art in a way of ſin, and near to fall into it, it may be on a ſudden thou heareſt within thee ſome contrary whiſperings, which alſo are above the whiſperings of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience, common to the wicked; or in caſe of good, it may be on a ſudden thou heareſt within thee ſome independent, ſupernatural perſwaſions, and reaſonings to this or that good, or to this or that object, which may more eaſily lead thee to chuſe the good: in theſe caſes thou mayeſt conjecturally think, that theſe whiſperings or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94897:118"/> motions are of the Angels of God. <hi>Bodin</hi> tells a ſtory of one who deſired of God a guidance, and aſſiſtance of an Angel; and accordingly he had ſencible manifeſtations of a Spirit that aſſiſted him, and followed him till his death; if in company he ſpake any unwary words, he was ſure to be advertiſed, and reproved for it by a dream in the night; or if he read any Book that was not good, the Angel would ſtrike upon the book, to cauſe him to leave it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But how ſhould we diſcern what is ſpoken by the immediate inſpiration of the ſpirit, and what by the mediation of the Angels? here indeed we are at a ſtand; and therefore my beſt reſolution is that of <hi>Calvin, That in ſuch ſecrets we ſhould keep one rule of modeſty and ſobriety; and that we ſhould neither ſpeak, nor think, nor yet deſire to know any other thing than ſuch as hath been taught us by Gods Word.</hi> I know not any great uſe there may be of this Queſtion, and therefore I ſhall not amuſe my ſelf in giving any account of it; only theſe remain as ſure truths. 1. That the things communicated to our inward man, (I mean thoſe inward motions, and ſuggeſtions to holineſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) are frequently and uſually by the adminiſtration of Angels. 2. That the ſame things communicated to our inward man, are ever originally and primarily from the Spirit of Chriſt; and hence it is that commonly we put them all on that ſcore, we give them all to Chriſts Spirit. 3. That 'tis proper to the ſpirit to enlighten the, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and to determine the will effectually; the Angels are but Ciſterns, the ſpirit is the fountain; the Angels may ſpeak and move us to our duties, but the bleſſing, the efficacy is of the Spirit, and in this reſpect we leave to Chriſt and his Spirit <hi>the all in all.</hi> Well then, O my ſoul, conſider (eſpecially in Church aſſemblies, and in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ordinances) the eſpecial preſence of Chriſt, in the preſence of his ſpirit, and in the preſence of his Angels: What? doſt thou feel any ſtirrings, actings, movings in thy ſpirit? doſt thou feel any quickening, warming, feeding, cheriſhing, healing,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.16, 17</note> mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying, melting, comforting, ſtrengthening in thy inward parts? ſay then, <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place,—this is none other but the Houſe of God, this is the gate of Heaven.</hi> O here is the Spirit, and here are the Angels aſcending, and deſcending; and therefore avoid Sathan! avoid all prophane thoughts, and earthly-mindedneſs! avoid dulneſs, deadneſs, drouſineſs! avoid looſeneſs, laſciviouſneſs, and all irreverence,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.10.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe of the Angels;</hi> and becauſe of the Spirit; and becauſe of the eſpecial preſence of Chriſt which encauſes them both.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider the the Preaching of Chriſt. O the admirable Sermons of this great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet! the Spouſe tells us, <hi>His Lips like Lillies dropped ſweet ſmelling Myrrh,</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was ſweet as the Lillies, and ſound as the Myrrh; <hi>His Lipps were like Lillies,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But what is it in Chriſt's Life that is ſo deſirable? I anſwer, every paſſage or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar named; yea, every thing of Chriſt is deſirable (named or un-named) all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Chriſt in any kind whatſoever (if to the former particulars, I ſhould add a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and a thouſand more) it is very precious, and excellent, and neceſſary, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and comfortable, and therefore deſirable: but to put them in order:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The meaneſt things of Chriſt are deſirable things; the very filings of Gold, the duſt or ſparkles of precious Stones are of real price and value, yea, of much worth; yea, the very Leaves of the Tree of Life are healing: the very Hem of Chriſt's garment, but even touched, ſends forth its vertue: the meaneſt and worſt things of Chriſt are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably to be deſired above all things; the duſt of <hi>Zion,</hi> the very ground that Chriſt's feet treadeth on, any thing that hath the pooreſt relation to Jeſus Chriſt, it is deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for him. Hence we read that one poor woman ſought no more of him but to waſh Chriſt's feet, and to kiſs them; another woman breaths out theſe deſires after Chriſt, <hi>If I may but touch the hem of his garment, I ſhall be whole.</hi>

Oh my ſoul, wouldſt thou but run through his Life, and conſider ſome of his more eminent actions, in relation to his Friends, or in relation to his Enemies, what deſires would theſe kindle in thine heart after Chriſt? 1. To his Friends, he was ſweet and indulgent; where there was any beginnings of Grace, he did encourage it: ſo was the Propheſie, <hi>A bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoking flax ſhall he not quench:</hi> Nay,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.20.</note> where was but a repreſentation of Grace, he ſeemed to accept of it: Thus, when the young man came and ſaid, <hi>What good thing ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> he embraced him,<note place="margin">Mar. 10.17, 21</note> and made much of him; <hi>then Jeſus beholding him, he loved him:</hi> And ſo the Scribe which asked him, <hi>which is the firſt Commandment of all?</hi> in the concluſion Chriſt told him,<note place="margin">Mar. 12.28, 34</note>

To his enemies he was kind and merciful; many a time he diſcovers himſelf moſt of all unto ſinners; he was never more familiar with any at firſt acquaintance, than with the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> that was an Adultreſs; and <hi>Mary,</hi> that had been a ſinner, how ſweetly did he appear to her at the very firſt view? how ready was he to receive ſinners? how ready to pardon and forgive ſinners? how gracious to ſinners after the pardon and forgiveneſs of ſin? See it in <hi>Peter,</hi> he never caſt him in the teeth with his Apoſtaſie, he never upbraided him with it, he never ſo much as tells him of it; only he looks upon him: and afterwards, <hi>Loveſt thou me? O</hi> Peter, <hi>loveſt thou me? why,</hi> Peter <hi>loveſt thou me?</hi> Often he was wronged and injured by men, but what then? was he all on a heat? did he call for fire down from heaven to deſtroy them?

                  <p n="4">4. LEt us <hi>hope in Jeſus</hi> carrying on the great work of our Salvation in his Life. By this <hi>hope</hi> I mean not a fluctuating, wavering, doubtful hope, but an aſſured <hi>hope;</hi> an hope well grounded. The main ſoul queſtion is, whether Chriſt's life be mine? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all thoſe paſſages of his life l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Apoſtle tells us, that God <hi>gives good hopes through Grace;</hi> if <hi>hope</hi> be right and good,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.16.</note> it will manifeſt it ſelf by operations of ſaving Grace: O look into thy ſoul! what gracious effects of the life of Chriſt are there? certainly his life is not with out ſome influence on our ſpirits, if we be his Members, and he be our Head. The Head we ſay, communicates life and ſenſe, and motion to his members; and ſo doth Chriſt communicate a ſpiritual life and ſenſe, and motion to his members; O the glorious effects flowing out of Chriſt's life into a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſoul! I ſhall lay down theſe. As,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If Chriſt's life be mine, then am I freed from the Law of ſin: This was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles evidence; <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> 
                     <hi>hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death.</hi> Chriſt's Life is called <hi>the Spirit of Life,</hi> becauſe of its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this Spirit of Life hath ſuch a power in it, here termed a <hi>Law,</hi> that it works out in Believers a freedom <hi>from the Law or Power in Sin.</hi> I cannot think, notwithſtanding the influence of Chriſt's life on me, but that ſin ſtill-ſticketh in me, I am ſtill a ſinner in reſpect of the inherency of ſin, but I am freed from the power of ſin <hi>(i.e.)</hi> from the guilt of ſin, as to its condemning power; and from the filth of ſin as to its ruling reigning power:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Let not ſin reign in your mortal bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>I grant there is ſome difference among Divines in their expreſſions, concerning the ſins of Gods own people, though they mean one and the ſelf-ſame thing. Some call them only <hi>ſins of infirmity;</hi> and others grant the name of <hi>reigning ſins;</hi> but with this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that this is not a total reigning. Sin reigneth as a Tyrant over them, not as a King; at ſometimes (as in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe) the will and conſent may run along with ſin, no actual reſiſtance may be made againſt ſin at all;<note place="margin">1 John 3.9.</note> and yet at the very ſame time <hi>the ſeed of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in them,</hi> though it ſeem dead; and in Gods good time, that very ſeed will revive again, and throw out the Tyrant; there is not, cannot be that antecedent and conſequent conſent to ſin in the godly, as in the wicked: O my ſoul, conſider this! if the vertue of Chriſt's life come in, it will take down that ſoveraign high reign of ſin which the wicked ſuffer, and will not ſtrive againſt; the fleſh indeed may ſometimes luſt againſt the Spirit, but it ſhall not totally prevail or get the upper hand; <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> Sin may tyrannize in me for a time, but it ſhall not King it in me. Look to this!<note place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> Doth the power and dominion of Chriſts Life throw out of thy heart and life that Kingly power and dominion of my ſin? here is one ground of <hi>hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Chriſt's life be mine, then ſhall I walk even as he walked; ſuch is the efficacy of Chriſt's life, that it will work ſutableneſs, and make our life in ſome ſort like his life. The Apoſtle obſerves that our communion with Chriſt works on our very conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; <hi>he that abideth in him, walkes even as he walked:</hi> and to this purpoſe are all thoſe holy admonitions; <hi>walk in love, as Chriſt alſo loved us.</hi>—and,<note place="margin">1 John 2.6. Eph. 5.2. John 13.15. 1 Pet. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>I have given you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that you ſhould do as I have done unto you.</hi>—And, <hi>as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> Then is Chriſt's life mine, when my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons refer to him as my Copy, when I tranſcribe the Original of Chriſt's life (as it were, to the life. Alas, what am I better to obſerve in the life of Chriſt his Charity to his Enemies, his Reprehenſions of the Scribes and Phariſees, his ſubordination to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, his ingenuity towards all men, his effuſions of love towards all the Saints,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:94897:122"/> if there be no likeneſs of all this in my own actions? The Life of Jeſus is not deſcribed to be like a Picture in a chamber of Pleaſure, only for beauty and entertainment of the eye, but like the <hi>Egyptain Hieroglyphicks,</hi> whoſe very feature is a precept, whoſe Images converſe with men by ſenſe, and ſignification of excellent diſcourſes; to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> ſaith <hi>Paul, we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed in the ſame Image from Glory to Glory:</hi> Chriſt is the Image of his Father, and we are the Images of Chriſt; Chriſt is Gods Maſterpeice, and the moſt excellent device and work, and frame of heaven that ever was, or ever ſhall be; now Chriſt being the top-excellency of all, he is moſt fit to be the the pattern of all excellencies whatſoever; and therefore he is the Image, the Idea, the Pattern, the Platform of all our ſanctification. Come then, O my ſoul, <hi>look unto Jeſus,</hi> and look into thy ſelf; yea, and look and look, till thou art more transformed into his likeneſs: Is it ſo that thou art changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame image with Chriſt? took into his diſpoſition as it is ſet forth in the Goſpel? look into his carriage, look into his converſation at home and abroad; and then refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on thy ſelf; look there, and tell me, canſt thou find in thy ſelf a diſpoſition ſuitable to his diſpoſition, a carriage ſutable to his carriage, a converſation ſutable to his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? art thou every way like him in thy meaſure, in Goſpel allowance; in ſome ſweet reſemblance? why then, here's another ground of hope: O rejoyce in it, and bleſs God for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Chriſts life be mine, then ſhall I admire, adore, believe, and obey this Chriſt. All theſe were the effects of thoſe ſeveral paſſages in Chriſt's life reſpectively. 1. They admire at his Doctrine and Miracles:<note place="margin">Luke 4.22. Matth. 15.31.</note> For his Doctrine; <hi>all bear him witneſs, and wondered at thoſe gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth:</hi> and for his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; <hi>they wondred, and they glorified the God, the God of Iſrael:</hi> yea ſometimes their admiration was ſo great, <hi>that they were ſore amazed in themſelves beyond meaſure, and wondred.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 6.51. Luke. 9.43.</note>—<hi>They were amazed at the mighty Power of God, and they wondred every one at all things which Jeſus did.</hi> 2. <hi>And as they admired, ſo they adored: there came a Leaper and worſhipped him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 8.2. Matth. 9.18. Matth. 14.33.</note> 
                     <hi>ſaying, if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean:</hi> and there came a Ruler and worſhipped him, ſaying, <hi>My Daughter is even now dead, come lay thy hand on her, and ſhe ſhall live;</hi> and <hi>they that were in the Ship came and worſhipped, ſaying, of a truth thou art the Son of God.</hi> The very worſhipping of Chriſt confeſſeth thus much, that he is the Son of God. 3. And as they adored, ſo they believed: <hi>If thou canſt believe</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to the Father of the poſſeſſed Child) <hi>all things are poſſible to him that believeth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 9.23, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſtraight way he cried out, and ſaid with tears, Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi> And when many of his Diſciples fell away, then ſaid Jeſus to the twelve, will ye alſo go away? <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers for the reſt, <hi>to whom ſhall we go?</hi>—Why Lord, <hi>we believe,</hi>

                     <hi>and are ſure that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living God:</hi> not only worſhipping of Chriſt, but believing in Chriſt is a right acknowledgment that Chriſt is God.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17. Mat. 4.19, 20, 22.</note> 4. And as they believed, ſo they obeyed: <hi>ye have obeyed from the heart</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans) that form of Doctrine which was delivered to you;</hi> no ſooner <hi>Peter and Andrew</hi> heard the voice of Chriſt, <hi>follow me,</hi> but they <hi>left all and followed him:</hi> and no ſooner <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> heard the ſame voice of Chriſt, <hi>follow me,</hi> but they <hi>left all and followed him;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 9.9. John 8.31.</note> and no ſooner <hi>Matthew, ſitting at the receipt of cuſtom, heard that voice of Chriſt, follow me,</hi> but <hi>he roſe and followed him.</hi> Why <hi>then are ye my Diſciples indeed</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to the believing <hi>Jews) if ye continue in my word.</hi> Come then, put thy ſelf, O my ſoul, to the teſt; thou haſt ſeen and heard, the wonderfull paſſages of Chriſt's Life; the Baptiſm of Chriſt, the Faſting of Chriſt, the Temptations of Chriſt, the Manifeſtations of Chriſt; the Doctrine of Chriſt, the Miracles of Chriſt, the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt; and is this the iſſue of all? Doſt thou now begin to admire, and adore, and believe, and to obey this Chriſt? is thy heart warmed? thy affections kindled? <hi>Forbs</hi> tells us that the word of God hath three degrees of opperation in the hearts of his choſen, <hi>firſt it falleth to mens ears as the ſound of many waters, a mighty, great, and confuſed ſound, and which commonly brings neither terrour nor joy, but yet a wandering and acknowledgment of a ſtrange force, and more than humane power, this is that effect which many felt hearing Chriſt, when they were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine, as teaching with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 1.22, 27. Luke 4.32. John 7.46.</note> 
                     <hi>what manner of Doctrine is this? never man ſpake like this man: the next ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is the voice of thunder, which bringeth not only wonder, but fear alſo: not only fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ears with ſound and the heart with aſtoniſhment, but moreover ſhaketh and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the conſcience: the third effect is the ſound of harping, while the Word not only ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſheth with admiration, and ſtriketh the Conſcience with terror, but alſo laſtly filleth it
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94897:122"/> with ſweet peace and joy.</hi> In the preſent caſe, give me leave to ask, O my ſoul, art thou ſtruck into a maze at the mighty Miracles, and divine Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt? doſt thou fall down and worſhip him as the Lord and thy God? doſt thou believe in him, and relie on him for Life and Salvation? doſt thou obey him, and follow the Lamb which way ſoever he goes? doſt thou act from Principles of Grace in newneſs of life, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of converſation? doſt thou walk anſwerably to the commands of Jeſus Chriſt; or at leaſt is there in thee an earneſt endeavour ſo to walk, and is it the ſorrow of thy ſoul, when thou obſerveſt thy failings? and doſt thou rejoyce in ſpirit when thou art led by the Spirit? why then here's another ground hope, that virtue is gone of Chriſt's life into thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Chriſt's life be mine, then <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks out this evidence, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live,</hi> &amp;c. he conjoins the death of Chriſt, and the life of Chriſt in one and the ſame ſoul; <hi>q. d.</hi> no man knows the benefit of Chriſts death, but he that feels the virtue of Chriſt's life; there's no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſts dying for us, but as we feel Chriſt living in us; if the power of Chriſts death mortifie my luſts, then the virtue of Chriſt's life will quicken my ſoul: but what means he by this, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me?</hi> It ſeems ſome Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; <hi>I live, yet not I:</hi> but a right interpretation reconciles all; as this, I live to God, and not unto my ſelf; I live to Chriſt, and not unto the World; I live according to the Will of God, and not after my own luſt and fancy; or (as ſome would have it) I live under grace, and not under the Law. <hi>q. d. Sometimes I lived wholly under the Law, which made me a perſecutor of the Church of God, which wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence, and ſlew me; and then I found my ſelf to be dead in ſin: but now I have embraced Chriſt, and am no more the man I was; now I feel Chriſt quickning, ruling, guiding, and ſtrengthning me by his Spirit, now I live ſpiritually and holily, not of my ſelf, but from another:</hi> The very whole of Chriſtians is from Chriſt; Chriſt is both Fountain-filling, and Life-quickning; <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Chriſts life hath an influence, infuſion, tranſmiſſion into our ſelves in reference to ſpiritual life: Look as the Heavens by an influence into the Earth, do quicken and enliven the Earth, and make all the ſeeds and roots hidden in the Earth, to revive and put forth themſelves;<note place="margin">Matth. 4.2.</note> ſo there is an influence that goes forth from the Sun of Righteouſneſs into the Souls of men, reviving and quickning them, and making them of dead, to become living; and of barren, to become fruitful; <hi>To you ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his wings, and ye ſhall go forth, and grow up as the Calves of the Stall.</hi> O my Soul! queſtion thy ſelf in theſe few particulars; doſt thou live to God, and not to thy ſelf? doſt thou live to Chriſt, and not to the World? doſt thou derive thy life from Chriſt? and hath that life of Chriſt a ſpecial influence into thy ſoul? doſt thou feel Chriſt living in thy underſtanding and will, in thy imagination and affections, in thy duties and ſervices? 1. In thy underſtanding, by prizing the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, by determining to know nothing in compariſon of Chriſt? 2. In thy will, by making thy will free to chuſe and embrace Chriſt; and by making his will to rule is thy will? 3. In thy imagination, by thinking upon him with more frequency and delight; by having more high, and honorable, and ſweeter apprehenſions of Chriſt than of all the Creatures? 4. In thy affections, by fearing Chriſt above all earthly powers, and by loving Chriſt above all earthly perſons? 5. In thy duties and ſervices, by doing all thou doſt in his Name, by his aſſiſtance, and for his glory? why then here's another ground of thy hope, ſurely thou haſt thy part in Chriſts Life.</p>
                  <p>Away, away with all dejecting doubts, and perplexing fears! while Chriſt was in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> eye, he ſaid, <hi>I dare not deſpond, I know who hath ſaid it, and I dare build upon it; this Anchor of hope thus caſt out, and faſtning upon Chriſt, it would be admirably uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful when Billows of Temptation beat upon Souls; this Helmet of Hope thus uſed, would keep off many blows, whereby the comforts of diſtruſtful ſpirits are many times ſadly bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi> O my Soul, look to the grounds of thy hope! if thou findeſt the power of ſin dying in thee, if thou walkeſt as Chriſt walked, if thou admireſt, adoreſt, believeſt, and obeyeſt thy Chriſt; if thou liveſt, and liveſt not, but in deed, and in truth, it is Chriſt that lives in thee; why then thou maiſt comfortably hope and aſſure thy ſelf that Chriſts habitual righteouſneſs, and actual holineſs is imputed to thy juſtification; thou maiſt confidently reſolve that every paſſage of Chriſts Life (ſo far as Legal or Moral) belongs unto thee. What? would ever Chriſt have come with his power againſt thy power of ſin, if he had not meant to reſcue thee? Would Chriſt ever have ſet thee a Copy, and have held thy hand and thy heart, to have writ legibly after him, if he had
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94897:123"/> not meant thee for a <hi>Scribe inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 13.55.</note> would Chriſt in his ſeveral actings have ſet himſelf before thee as the Object of Admiration, Adoration, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Obedience, if he had not meant to own thee, and to be owned by thee? would Chriſt ever have come ſo near to thee, as to have lived in thee, to have been the ſoul of thy ſoul, and the life of thy life, the <hi>All</hi> of thy underſtanding and will, imaginations and affections, duties and ſervices, if he had not purpoſed to have <hi>ſaved thee by his life?</hi>

O what am I, or what is my Fathers Houſe? If God ſhould let me live one year in Heaven, it were infinite mercy; but that the God of Heaven ſhould live ſo many years on Earth, and that all that while he ſhould empty himſelf, in watching, faſting, praying, preaching for my ſake; Oh the depth!

                  </p>
                  <p>Sweet Soul, be not faithleſs, but believing; I know it is an hard and difficult thing; but to help on a trembling ſoul, I ſhall firſt direct, and then encourage.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for direction, let ſouls be acquainted how to act their Faith on Chriſt in reſpect of his Life. The manner of its proceedings I ſuppoſe is thus:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith muſt directly go to Chriſt. Many poor ſouls humbled for ſin, and taken off from their own bottom, they run immediately to the promiſe of pardon, and cloſe with it, and reſt on it, not ſeeking for, or cloſing with Chriſt in the promiſe; this is a common error among thouſands; but we ſhould obſerve, that the firſt promiſe that was given, was not a bare word ſimply promiſing pardon, peace, or any other benefit, which God would beſtow; but it was a promiſe of Chriſt's Perſon, as overcoming Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> and purchaſing thoſe benefits, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi> So, when the Promiſe was renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was not a bare promiſe of bleſſedneſs and forgivneſs, but of <hi>that Seed,</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.6. in whom that bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was conveyed;<note place="margin">Gen. 22.18.</note> 
                     <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> So that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith firſt cloſed with Chriſt in the Promiſe, and therefore he is ſaid to <hi>ſee Chriſt's day, and to rejoyce</hi> in embracing him. Chriſt in the firſt place, and more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, is every where made the thing which Faith embraceth to ſalvation, and whom it looks unto and reſpects,<note place="margin">John 3.16. John 11.25.</note> as it makes us righteous in the ſight of God. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.—I am the reſurrection and the life, he that believeth in me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13.39. Acts 16.31. Acts 10.43.</note> 
                     <hi>though he were dead, yet ſhall he live.— And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi>—and, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>—And, <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins.</hi> And hence it is that Faith is called <hi>the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 2.16. Phil. 3.9. Becauſe Chriſt is it whom Faith apprehends immediately; and as for the other promiſes they depend all on this,<note place="margin">John 3.36. John 6.47.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins:</hi> and <hi>he that believeth on the Son of God ſhall have life everlaſting; verily, verily I ſay unto you,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:94897:123"/> he that believeth on me hath everlaſting life.</hi> O remember this in the firſt place, Faith muſt go unto Chriſt; and yet I mean not to Chriſt, as abſtractly and nakedly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but to Chriſt as compaſs'd with all his Promiſes, Priviledges, Benefits.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith muſt go to Chriſt, as God in the fleſh. Some make this the difference of Faiths acting betwixt Believers of the New and Old Teſtament: Under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when Chriſt was but in the Promiſe, and not as then come in the fleſh, their Faith had a more uſual recourſe unto God himſelf; as for Chriſt (God-man, man-God) they had not ſo diſtinct, but only a confuſed knowledge of him; and therefore we read not ſo frequently and uſually of their recourſe unto him, but only unto God.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.12, 20. Pſal. 78.21, 22</note>

                  <p n="3">3. Faith muſt go to Chriſt as God in the fleſh, made under the Law:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> and hence it is that the Apoſtle joynes theſe together, <hi>God ſent his Son made of a woman, made under the Law:</hi> If Chriſt had been out of the compaſs of the Law, his being incarnate, and made of a woman, had done us no good. Suppoſe one in debt, and danger of the Law, to have a Brother of the ſame fleſh and blood, of the ſame Father and Mother; what will this avail, if that ſame Brother will not come under the Law <hi>(i.e.)</hi> become his Surety, and undertake for him? It is our caſe; we are debtors to God,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> and there is <hi>an hand-writing againſt us, and contrary to us:</hi> here is a Bond of the Law which we have forfeited; now what would Chriſt avail, if he had not come under the Law, if he had not been our Surety, and undertook for us? Our Faith therefore muſt go to Chriſt as <hi>made under the Law,</hi> not only taking our nature upon him, but our debt alſo;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as men, and our debt as ſinful men: <hi>He hath made himſelf to become ſin for us who knew no ſin, (i.e.)</hi> he made him to be handled as a ſinner for us under the Law, though he knew no ſin on his part, but continued in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them. If Faith be inquiſitive, when was Chriſt made under the Law? I anſwer,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.3.</note> even then when he was circumciſed: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> proteſts, <hi>I teſtifie to every man that he that is circumciſed, is a debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> Chriſt at his Circumciſion entred into bond with us, and undertook for us; and therefore then, and not till then,<note place="margin">Luke 2.21.</note> he had his Name given him, <hi>Jeſus a Saviour:</hi> and from that time he was a debtor <hi>to do the whole Law.</hi> Not only to ſuffer, but alſo to do; for he both ſatisfied the Curſe, and fulfilled the Commandments. O remember this! as Chriſt, and as Chriſt in the fleſh, ſo Chriſt in the fleſh made under the Law, is principally to be in the eye of of our Faith. If we put all together, our firſt view of Faith is to <hi>look on Chriſt God in the fleſh, made under the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith going to Chriſt as God in the fleſh, and as made under the Law, it is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to look to the end and meaning of Chriſt, as being God in the fleſh, and as fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Law.</p>
                  <p>Now if we would know the meaning of Chriſt in all this, the Apoſtle tells us of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and of a more immediate end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of a remote end: <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.4, 5.</note>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:94897:124"/> 
                     <hi>to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons.</hi> This was Chriſt's meaning, or the remote end of Chriſt. Alas! we were ſtrangers from the Adoption, and we lay under the Law as men whom ſentence had paſſed on: Now from this latter we are redeemed; he was under the Law, that we might be redeemed from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; nor is that all; but as we are <hi>redeemed,</hi> ſo are we <hi>adopted the Children of God:</hi> And this end I rather attribute to the Life of Chriſt, <hi>that we might receive the Adoption (i.e.)</hi> from the eſtate of Priſoners condemned, that we might be tranſlated into the eſtate of children adopted. O the mercy of God! who ever heard of a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man to be afterwards adopted? would not a condemned Priſoner think himſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to eſcape with Life? But the zeal of the Lord of Hoſts hath performed this; we are in Chriſt both pardoned and adopted; and by this means the joy and glory of Gods heavenly inheritance is eſtated upon us: O let our Faith look mainly to this deſign and plot of Chriſt! he was made under the Law, yea, and under the directive part of the Law by his life; he fulfilled every jot and title of the Law by his active obedience, that we might be entitled to glory; that we might be adopted to the inheritance of the Saints in glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the more immediate end of Chriſt: the Apoſtle tells us Chriſt was made under the Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.4.</note> or fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, <hi>that the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> In Chriſt's life were we repreſented, and ſo this fulfilling of all righteouſneſs is accounted ours; <hi>that the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> O my ſoul, look to this! Herein lies the pith and the marrow of thy Juſtification: of thy ſelf thou canſt do nothing that good is; but Chriſt fulfilled the Law in thy ſtead; and if now thou wilt but act, and exerciſe thy Faith, thou mayſt thereby find and feel the vertue and efficacy of Chriſt's righteouſneſs and actual obedience, flowing into thy own ſoul. But here is the queſtion, how ſhould I manage my Faith? or how ſhould I act it to feel Chriſt's righteouſneſs <hi>my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> I anſwer, 1. Thy way is to diſcover and diſcern this righteouſneſs of Chriſt, this holy and perfect life of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the whole, and in all the parts of it, as it is laid down in the written Word; Much hath been ſaid of it in thoſe four years of Chriſt's Miniſtry, but eſpecially in the laſt year; I ſhall ſay more anon in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto Chriſt, whither alſo thou mayſt have recourſe. 2. Thy way is to believe and to receive this diſcovery as ſacred and unqeſtionable in reference to thy own ſoul, as intended for thee, for thy uſe and benefit. 3. Thy way is to apprehend, apply, and to improve this diſcovery according to that judgment and propoſal, to thoſe uſes, ends, and benefits to which thou believeſt they were deſigned. Yea, but there lies the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how may that be done? I anſwer,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Setting before thee that diſcovery (that perfect life of Chriſt in the whole, and all the parts of it) thou muſt firſt endeavour to be deeply humbled for thy great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereto in whole and in part.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Still keeping thy Spirit intent on the Pattern, thou muſt quicken, provoke and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy ſluggiſh and drowſie ſoul with renewed, redoubled vigilancy, and induſtry to come up higher towards it, and (if it were poſſible) compleatly to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet having the ſame diſcovery, rule and copy before thee, thou muſt exerciſe faith thereupon, as that which was performed, and is accepted on thy behalf. And ſo go to God, and there repreſent, offer, and tender Chriſt's holy life and active obedience unto him. And that firſt to fill up the defects of thy utmoſt endeavour: Secondly, to put a righteouſneſs, price, value, and worth upon what thou doſt and attaineſt to. Thirdly, to make Chriſt's righteouſneſs thy own, that thou may'ſt ſay with the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> in way of aſſurance, <hi>O God my righteouſneſs.</hi> O my ſoul, if thou would'ſt thus live by Faith, or thus act thy Faith on Chriſt's Life, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, Chriſt's active obedience; what a bleſſed life would'ſt thou live? then mightſt thou find and feel Chriſt's righteouſneſs thy righteouſneſs; I ſay <hi>thy Righteouſneſs</hi> in reſpect of its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but not in reſpect of its formality; for ſo ſinners would be their own Mediators. But of ſome of theſe Particulars I ſhall ſpeak more largely in our conformity to Chriſt's holy Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For encouragements to bring on ſouls thus to believe on Chriſt, conſider,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fulneſs of this Object; Chriſt's life is full, it is very comprehenſive, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains holineſs, and happineſs, ſanctification, and juſtification: if Chriſt's Garments were healing, how much more ſo main and eſſential a part of Chriſt, even the half of Chriſt as it were? for ſo is Chriſt's Life. It is vehemently to be ſuſpected, that the true reaſon why ſo much is ſaid of his Death, and ſo little in compariſon of his Life, it is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:94897:124"/> either becauſe we underſtand not the fulneſs of his life, or becauſe we are carnal and ſelfiſh, affecting freedom from hell, more than holineſs on earth; ſome benefit by Chriſt, more than conformity to Chriſt. O come! ſee the fulneſs of Chriſt's life: in reference to our ſanctification, was it not an exact model of perfection? a moſt curious exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of Gods whole Word? an expreſs Idea, Image, Repreſentation of the whole mind of God? a full preſident for all others to walk by, to work by, to live by? and in reference to juſtification, is not Chriſt's life the object of Faith and juſtifying? nay, is not Chriſt's life the object of juſtifying faith, as well as Chriſt's death, reſurrection, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, ſeſſion, interceſſion? The aſſertors of Chriſt's active and paſſive obedience for us, can tell us of two things in the Law intended; one principal, <hi>viz.</hi> Obedience: and another ſecondary, <hi>viz.</hi> malediction upon ſuppoſition of diſobedience; ſo that ſin being once committed, there muſt be a double act to juſtification, the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Curſe, and the fulfilling of Righteouſneſs anew, the one is ſatisfaction for the injury we have done unto God as our Judge; and the other is a performance of a ſervice which we owe unto God as our Maker. O then how large, and full, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive is this life of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the excellency, the glory of this Object: Chriſt's life is glorious, and hence it is that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the moſt glorious garment that ever the Saints of God did wear. It is <hi>Marlorat</hi>'s ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Marlorat.</hi> Rev. 12.1.</note> that <hi>the Church which puts on Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, is more illuſtrious than the Ayr is by the Sun. John</hi> thus ſets her out in his Viſion; <hi>And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet.</hi> I take this to be a lofty Poetical deſcription of Chriſt's imputed righteouſneſs: imagine a garment were cut out of the Sun, and put upon us, how glorious ſhould we be? O but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is much more glorious: No wonder if the Church cloathed with the Sun, <hi>tread the Moon under her feet (i.e.)</hi> if ſhe trample on all ſublunary things, which are uncertain and changeable as the Moon, <hi>I count all things but dung</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that I may win Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>and be found in him; not having my own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> compares Chriſt's righteouſneſs with the glory of the world, then is the world but dung. O the glory, O the excellency of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider the ſuitableneſs of this object; Chriſt's life, and the virtue of it, is moſt ſuitable to our condition. Thus I might apply Chriſt to every condition; if thou art ſick, he is a Phyſitian; if thou feareſt death, he is the <hi>way, the truth, and the life;</hi> if thou art hungry, he is the bread of Life; if thou art thirſty, he is the water of Life: But not to inſiſt on theſe words. It is the daily complaint of the beſt of Saints, <hi>O my ſins! I had thought theſe ſins had been wholly ſubdued, but now I feel they return upon me again; now I feel the ſprings in the bottom fill up my ſoul again; Oh I am weary of my ſelf, and weary of my life, Oh what will become of me?</hi> In this caſe now Chriſt's life is moſt ſutable, his righteouſneſs is a continual righteouſneſs; it is not a Ciſtern,<note place="margin">Zech. 13.1.</note> but <hi>Fountain open for thee to waſh in; as ſin abounds,</hi> ſo <hi>grace</hi> in this gift of righteouſneſs <hi>abounds much more.</hi> Chriſt's life in this reſpect, is compared to <hi>changes of Garments:</hi> Thou crieſt, <hi>O what ſhall become of me? Oh I feel new ſins, and old ſins committed afreſh;</hi> why but theſe <hi>changes of garments</hi> will hide all thy ſins:<note place="margin">Zech. 3.4.</note> if thou art but cloathed with the robes of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, there ſhall never enter into the Lords heart one hard thought towards thee of caſting thee off, or of taking revenge upon any new occaſion or fall into ſin. Why here is the bleſſedneſs of all thoſe that believe. Oh then believe! Say not, <hi>would Chriſt be incarnate for me? would he lead ſuch a life on earth for my ſoul?</hi> Why yes, for thy ſoul: never ſpeak of thy ſins, as if they ſhould be any hinderance of thy Faith. If the wicked that apply this righteouſneſs preſumptiouſly, can ſay, <hi>Let us ſin that grace may abound,</hi> and ſo they make no other uſe of Grace, but to run in debt, and to ſin with a licence; how much rather mayeſt thou ſay on good ground, <hi>Oh let me believe! Oh let me own my portion in this righteouſneſs of Chriſt! that as my ſins have abounded, ſo my love may abound; that as my ſins have been exceeding great, ſo the Lord may be exceeding ſweet; that as my ſins continue and encreaſe, ſo my thankfulneſs to Chriſt, and glory in God, and triumph over ſin, death, and the grave, may alſo encreaſe.</hi> Why thus be encouraged to believe thy part in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

O God forbid! awake! awake thy ardent love towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! why thou art rock, and not fleſh, if thou beeſt not wounded with theſe heavenly darts; Chriſt loves thee, is not that enough? fervent affection is apt to draw love, where is little or no beauty; and excellent beauty is apt to draw the heart where there is no anſwer of affection at all; but when theſe two meet together, what breaſt can hold againſt them?

                     <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> Of Joying in Jeſus in that reſpect.</head>
                  <p n="7">7. LEt us <hi>joy in Jeſus,</hi> as carrying on the great work of our Salvation for us, during his Life. But what is there in Chriſt's life, or in all the paſſages of his Life to ſtir up Joy? I anſwer, all his life, and all the paſſages of his life, if rightly applied, are excellent matter for the ſtirring up of this Affection: indeed the main of the work is in the application of Chriſt's life; if ever we rejoyce ſpiritually in Chriſt, we muſt bring together the object and the faculty; and this Union of the object and the faculty, is uſually wrought by contemplation, or by confidence, or by fruition; I ſhall but a while inſiſt on theſe, that we may come up at laſt to rejoyce in Chriſt, yea, if it were poſſible to rejoyce, and again rejoyce.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us contemplate on this life of Chriſt, let us think of it in our minds; there is a kind of delight in knowing ſome things ſpeculatively, which we would abhor to know experimentally; and therefore the Devil's firſt temptation was drawn from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of evil, as well as good; he knew that the mind of man would receive content in the underſtanding of that, which in its own nature had no perfection at all; now if there be a delight in the contemplation of evil, how much more in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which is good? And is not the life of Chriſt, the Graces, the Virtues, the holy Actions, the dear Affections of Jeſus Chriſt to us-ward, good, and very good? Come then, ſtir up our memories, let us be ſetled men; let us ſpend our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thoughts upon this bleſſed Object; the reaſon we miſs of our joyes, is, becauſe we are ſo little in comtemplations of our Chriſt. It is ſaid that <hi>he pities us in our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, but he delights in us, when we delight in him.</hi> Certainly he would have us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, and to that purpoſe he way-layes our thoughts, that whereſoever we look, we ſhall ſtill think on him: O my ſoul, caſt thine eyes which way thou wilt, and thou ſhalt hardly look on any thing, but Chriſt Jeſus hath taken the name of that very thing upon himſelf. What, is it day? and doſt thou behold the Sun? He is called <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 4.2. Num. 24.17, 19.</note> Or, is it night? and doſt thou behold the Stars? He is called a Star: <hi>There ſhall come a Star out of Jacob—out of Jacob ſhall he come that ſhall have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> Or, is it Morning? and doſt thou behold the morning-ſtar? He is called the <hi>bright morning-ſtar.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 22.16.</note> Or, is it Noon? and doſt thou behold clear light all the world over in thy Hemiſphere? He is called <hi>the Light,</hi> and <hi>that Light,</hi> and <hi>that Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.7, 8, 9.</note> Or, to come a little nearer; if thou lookeſt on the earth, and takeſt a view of the Creatures about thee, ſeeſt thou the ſilly ſheep? He is called a ſheep;<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.7.</note>

                     <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Art thou eating meat, and takeſt a view on what is on thy Table? He is called <hi>Bread: The bread of God, true bread from Heaven, the bread of life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 6.32, 35, 51.</note> 
                     <hi>the living bread which came down from heaven.</hi> Why thus Chriſt way-layes our thoughts, that whereſoever we look, we ſhould ever think of Chriſt—Now theſe thoughts or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of Chriſt, are they that bring together the object and the faculty of joy: I cannot think of Chriſt, or the life of Chriſt, of Chriſt preaching, or of Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but I muſt rejoyce in Chriſt; as ſometimes the Apoſtle ſaid; <hi>Chriſt is preached; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in pretence or truth, I matter not, but that he is preached, I therein do rejoyce,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1.18.</note> 
                     <hi>yea and will rejoyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us conſider in Chriſt, let us upon good grounds hope our ſhare and intereſt in the Life of Chriſt: O this would ſtrengthen our joy, yea fill us with joy unſpeakable and glorious; where true joy is, there is firſt a thinking of the good in our mind; and ſecondly, an expecting of it in our heart; hence it is that whatſoever doth encourage our hope, the ſame doth enlarge our delight; the Apoſtle joines both theſe together: <hi>Rejoyce in hope:</hi> Hope and Joy go both together; if I have but aſſured hope that Chriſt's life is mine, I cannot but rejoyce therein: on the contrary,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.12.</note> if my hope fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, if I am but uncertain, if I look on the influence and benefits of Chriſt's life as only poſſibly mine, and no further; then is my comfort but unſtable and weak: ſometimes we find Chriſt compared to a rich Store-houſe: <hi>In him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are hid all the treaſures of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Zacheus</hi> in the Sycamore Tree heard but Chriſt's voice, <hi>Zacheus make haſte, and come down; for to day I muſt abide in thy houſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 19.5, 6.</note> O what haſte made <hi>Zacheus</hi> to receive Chriſt! he came down haſtily, and received him joyfully. This offer of Chriſt to <hi>Zacheus</hi> is thine as well as his, if thy hope be right; <hi>Come down, poor Soul</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>this day muſt I abide in thy houſe.</hi> O then what joy ſhould there be in thy heart when Chriſt comes in, or when thou feeleſt Chriſt come in! <hi>The friend of the Bridegroom rejoyceth greatly becauſe of the Bridegroom</hi>'s <hi>voice;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.29.</note> how much more may the Bride her ſelf rejoyce.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us come up to more and more and more fruition of Chriſt; all other things work our delight but as they look towards this; now in this fruition of Chriſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe things: firſt a propriety unto Chriſt; for as a ſick man doth not feel the joy of a ſound mans health, ſo neither doth a ſtranger to Chriſt feel the joy of a Believer in Chriſt; how ſhould he joy in Chriſt that can make no claim to him in the leaſt degree? But to that we have ſpoken. Secondly, a poſſeſſion of Chriſt; this exceedingly enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our joy. O how ſweet was Chriſt to the Spouſe, when ſhe could ſay,<note place="margin">Cant. 6.3.</note> 
                     <hi>I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine; he feedeth among the Lillies, q. d.</hi> we have took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of each other; he is mine through faith, and I am his through love; we are both ſo knit by an inſeparable union, that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate us two; <hi>he feedeth among the Lillies;</hi> he refreſheth himſelf and his Saints, by his union and communion with them; many are taken up with the joy and comfort of outward poſſeſſions, but Chriſt is better than all; in one Chriſt is comprized every ſcattered comfort here below: <hi>Chriſt mine</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>and all mine.</hi> 3. An accommodation of Chriſt to the ſoul; and this is it that compleats our joy; It is not bare poſſeſſion of Chriſt which bringeth real delight; but an applying of Chriſt unto that end and purpoſe for which he was appointed: it is not the having of Chriſt, but the uſing of Chriſt, which makes him beneficial. O the uſefulneſs of Chriſt to all believing Souls! The Scriptures are full of this; as appears by all his Titles in Scripture; he is <hi>our life, our light, our bread, our water, our milk, our wine; his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed:</hi> he is our father, our brother, our friend, our husband, our King, our Prieſt, our Prophet: he is our juſtification, our ſanctification, our wiſdom, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; he is our peace, our mediation, our attonement, our reconciliation, our <hi>all in all.</hi> Alas! I look on my ſelf, and I ſee I am nothing, I have nothing without Jeſus
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94897:127"/> Chriſt, here's a temptation, I cannot reſiſt it; here's a corruption, I cannot overcome it; here's a perſecution, I cannot down with it: well, but Chriſt is mine, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and I have poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and I find enough in Chriſt to ſupply all my wants; he was ſet up on purpoſe to give me grace, and to renew my ſtrength, ſo that if I make my application to Chriſt, <hi>I can do all things,</hi> Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can ſuffer the loſs of all things,</hi> Phil. 3.8. I can conquer all things, nay, <hi>in all things be more than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour through him that loves me,</hi> Rom. 8.37. Oh the joy now that this accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation brings to my ſoul! I ſee it is nothing but Chriſt, and therefore I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.3.</note> or I muſt rejoyce in nothing at all: Surely <hi>we are the Circumciſion which rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my ſoul! where is thy faculty of joy? come bring it to this bleſſed object, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: If thou know'ſt not how, firſt contemplate on Chriſt; think on thoſe ſeveral paſſages in his life; thoſe that lived with him, and ſtood by to ſee them, it is ſaid of them,<note place="margin">Luke 13.17.</note> that <hi>they all rejoyced for the glorious things that were done by him.</hi> Or if thy heart be ſo dull and heavy, that this will not raiſe it up, then look to thy grounds of hope and confidence in Chriſt: ſo long as thou doubteſt of him, or of thy intereſt in him, how ſhouldſt thou rejoyce or be cheerful in thy ſpirit? The poor man could not ſpeak it without tears,<note place="margin">Mark 9.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief;</hi> a believing unbelief, a wavering, ſtaggering, trembling faith cannot be without ſome wounds in ſpirit: O be confident, and this will make thee chearful; or if yet thou feeleſt not this affection to ſtir, aſpire to fruition, yea to more and more fruition of Chriſt, and union with Chriſt; and to that purpoſe conſider thy propriety to Chriſt, thy poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and the accommodation or uſefulneſs of Chriſt to thy condition, whatſoever it is. What? will not theſe things move thy ſpiritual delight? canſt thou not hear Chriſt ſay; <hi>All I am is thine, and all I have done is thine, for thy uſe, and for thy benefit.</hi> And doth not thy heart leap within thee at each word? O my ſoul, I cannot check thee for thy deadneſs: it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Luke 19.37.</note> that when <hi>Chriſt was at the deſcent of the Mount of Olives, that the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Diſciples began to rejoyce, and praiſe God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had ſeen.</hi> What? a multitude of diſciples rejoycing in Chriſt's acts? and art not thou one amongſt the multitude? If thou art a Diſciple, rejoyce thou: ſurely it concerns thee as much as them; and therefore rejoyce, lift up thy voice in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with the reſt, <hi>rejoyce, and again rejoyce.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. LEt us <hi>call on Jeſus,</hi> or on God the Father in and through Jeſus. Thus we read that <hi>looking up to Jeſus,</hi> or lifting up the eyes to Jeſus, goes alſo for Prayer in Gods Book:<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.3.</note>

                  <p n="9">9.

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.7.</note> 
                     <hi>nor give to God a ranſom for him.

In his Ceremonial performances, as in going up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Feaſts; in his perpetual grave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; we never read that Jeſus laughed; and but once or twice that he rejoyced in ſpirit. Alas! the declenſions of our Natures cannot come up to this Pattern: nor do I look at theſe paſſages as any acts of moral obedience at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Affirmatively, or poſitively; we muſt conform to Chriſt's life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of his Judgment, Will, Affections, Compaſſions. Look we at his Spirit, obſerve what mind was in Jeſus Chriſt, and therein do we endeavour to conform: <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which was in Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 2.5.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.5.</note> And <hi>we have the mind of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 Cor. 2.16.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.16.</note>

                     <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we received, Grace for Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of his words, talk, ſpiritual and heavenly Language. The very Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Prieſts could ſay of Chriſt, <hi>Never man ſpake like this man:</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. In reſpect of his Carriage, Converſation, Cloſe-walking with God. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſets forth Chriſt as an high Prieſt, who <hi>was holy, harmleſs, undefiled,</hi>

                     </gap>, the word ſignifies properly to <hi>preach;</hi> ſo clearly ſhould we expreſs the virtues of Chriſt, as if our lives were ſo many Sermons of the life of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of all his acts, practiſes, duties of moral obedience; we find in the life of Chriſt many particular carriages, and acts of obedience to his heavenly Father; whereof ſome were moral, and ſome ceremonial: now all theſe are not for our imitation, but only ſuch moral acts, as concerning which, we have both his pattern and precept. Come, let us mark this one Rule, and we need no more; <hi>Whatſoever he commanded, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he did, of preciſe Morality, we are therein bound to follow his ſteps.</hi> I join together his Commands and Deeds, becauſe in thoſe things which he did, but commands not, we need not to conform; but in thoſe things which he both did and commanded, we are bound to follow him; in ſuch a caſe his Laws and Practice differ, but as a Map and guide, a Law, a Judge, a Rule, and Precedent.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of all theſe particulars, and eſpecially in reſpect of Chriſt's moral obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the whole life of Chriſt was a Diſcipline, a living, ſhining, and exemplary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept unto men; and hence it is that we find ſuch names given to him in Scripture, as ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies not only preheminence, but exemplarineſs; thus he was called a <hi>Prince,</hi> Dan. 9.25. <hi>a Leader,</hi> Iſa. 55.4. <hi>a Governour,</hi> Mat. 2.6. <hi>a Captain,</hi> 2.10. <hi>a chief Shepherd,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.4. <hi>aforerunner or conduct into glory,</hi> Heb. 2.20. <hi>a light to the Jews,</hi> Exod. 13.21. <hi>a light to the Gentiles,</hi> Luke 2.3. <hi>a light to every man that entreth into the world,</hi> John 1.9. All which titles, as they declared his dignity, ſo his exemplarineſs, that he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and pattern of holineſs to his people. And as for all other Saints, though they are imitable, yet with limitation unto him, only ſo far as they expreſs his life in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:<note place="margin">1 Cor 11.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I am of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſecond; why we muſt conform? upon what Motives? I anſwer, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath done and ſuffered very much to that end and purpoſe? Sometimes I have wondred why Chriſt would do ſo much, and ſuffer ſo much as the Evangeliſts in their hiſtories relate. This I believe, that Jeſus was perfect God, and perfect man; and that every action of his life, and but one hour of his Paſſion and death might have been ſatisfactory, and enough for the expiation and reconcilement of ten thouſand worlds; but now I am anſwered, that all thoſe inſtances of holineſs, and all thoſe kinds of virtues, and all thoſe degrees of paſſion, and all that effuſion of his blood, was partly on this account, that he might become an example to us, that he might ſhine to all the ages and generations of the world, and ſo be a guiding ſtar, and a pillar of fire to them in their journey towards heaven: O my ſoul, how doth this call on thee to conform to Chriſt? What? that a ſmaller expence ſhould be enough to thy juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet that the whole Magazine ſhould not procure thy ſanctification? that at a leſſer ſum of obedience God might have pardoned thy ſin, and yet at a greater ſum thou wilt not ſo much as imitate his holineſs? In a dark night, if an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, thou art ſo amuzed with that little flame, that thou art apt to follow it, and loſe thy ſelf; and wilt thou not follow the glories of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, who by ſo many inſtances calls upon thee, and who will guide thee into ſafety, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thee againſt all imaginable dangers? God forbid! If it had not been for thy imitation, I cannot think that Chriſt would have lived on earth ſo many years, to have done ſo many gracious and meritorious works. O think of this!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe Chriſt is the beſt and higheſt Exemplar of holineſs that ever the world ever had: hence we muſt needs conform to Chriſt (as the Apoſtle argues) becauſe <hi>he is the firſt-born among many Brethren;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.29.</note> the firſt in every kind is propounded as a pattern of the reſt; now Chriſt is the firſt-born. Chriſt is the head of all the predeſtinate, as the firſt-born was wont to be the head in all Families. The old ſaying is, <hi>Regis ad exemplar, &amp;c.</hi> A very deformity was ſometimes counted an honour, if it were in imitation of the Prince. It is ſtoried of <hi>Nero,</hi> that having a wry neck, there was ſuch an ambition in men to follow the Court, that it became the faſhion and Gallantry of thoſe times, to hold their necks awry; and ſhall not Chriſt, the King of Saints, be much more imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by his Saints?<note place="margin">Col. 1.18.</note> Chriſt is <hi>the head of the body, the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead, in all things he hath the preheminence;</hi> and the rule is general, that, <hi>that which is firſt and beſt
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:94897:128"/> in any kind, is the rule and meaſure of all the reſt.</hi> Why ſuch is Chriſt; O then let him be the guide of our life, and of our manners.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe Chriſt doth not only give us an example, but he doth cheriſh, ſuccour, and aſſiſt us by its eaſineſs, complacency, and proportion to us. Some ſweetly obſerve, that <hi>Chriſt's piety</hi> (which we muſt imitate) <hi>was even, conſtant, unblameable, comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with civil ſociety, without any affrightment of precedent, or without any prodigious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of actions, greater than the imitation of men.</hi> We are not commanded to imitate a life, whoſe ſtory tells us of extaſies in prayer, of abſtractions of ſenſes, of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary faſtings to the weakning of our ſpirits, and diſabling of all animal operations; no, no; but a life of juſtice, and temperance, and chaſtity, and piety, and charity, and devotion; ſuch a life as without which humane ſociety cannot be conſerved;— And it is very remarkable, that beſides the eaſineſs of this imitation, there is a virtue and efficacy in the life of Chriſt; a merit, and impetration in the ſeveral paſſages of Chriſt's life, to work out our imitation of him. In the <hi>Bohemian</hi> hiſtory it is reported that <hi>Winceſlaus</hi> their King, one winters night going to his devotion in a remote Church, his ſervant <hi>Podavivus,</hi> who waited on his Maſter, and endeavoured to imitate his Maſters piety, he began to faint through the violence of the ſnow, and cold; at laſt the King commanded him, to follow him, and to ſet his feet in the ſame footſteps which his feet ſhould mark, and ſet down for him; the ſervant did ſo, and preſently he fancied, or found a cure; thus Chriſt deals with us; it may be we think our way to Heaven is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, obſcure, and full of objection; well, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>But mark my footſteps; come on, and tread where I have ſtood, and you ſhall find the vertue of my example will make all ſmooth, and eaſie; you ſhall find the comforts of my company, you ſhall feel the vertue and influence of a perpetual guide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe Chriſt in his Word hath commanded us to follow his ſteps: <hi>Learn of me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11.19. John 13.13.14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye call me Maſter, and Lord, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am; if I then your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet, for I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you. —Put on therefore bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.12.13.</note> 
                     <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15, 16.</note>—<hi>And as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation; becauſe it is written, be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi>—Againſt this ſome object, how can we be holy as Chriſt is holy, firſt, the thing is impoſſible; and ſecondly, if we could, there would be no nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Chriſt. But I anſwer to the firſt; the thing if rightly underſtood, is not impoſſible; we are commanded to be holy as Chriſt is holy, not in reſpect of equality, as if our holineſs muſt be of the ſame compaſs with the holineſs of Chriſt; but in reſpect of quality, our holineſs muſt be of the ſame ſtamp, and truth, as the holineſs of Chriſt; as when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>That we muſt love our neighbor as our ſelf;</hi> the meaning is,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.9.</note> not that our love to our neighbor ſhould be Mathematically equal to the love of our ſelf, for the Law doth allow of degrees in love, accordingly to the degrees of relation in the thing beloved.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Do good unto all men, ſpecially to thoſe of the houſhold of faith;</hi> love to a friend may ſafely be greater than love to a ſtranger; or love to a wife, or child, may ſafely be greater than to a friend; yet in all our love to others, it muſt be of the ſelf ſame nature, as true, as real, as cordial, as ſincere, as ſolid as that to our ſelves; <hi>We muſt love our neighbor as our ſelves (i.e.)</hi> unfeignedly, and without diſſimulation.—Again, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to the ſecond, Chriſt is needful notwithſtanding our utmoſt holineſs in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. 1. Becauſe we cannot come to full and perfect holineſs, and ſo his grace is requiſite to pardon and cover our failings. 2. Becauſe that which we do attain unto, it is not of, or from our ſelves, and ſo his ſpirit is requiſite to ſtrengthen us unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. We muſt be holy as Chriſt is holy, yet ſtill we muſt look at the holineſs of Chriſt, as the ſun, and root, and fountain; and that our holineſs is but as a beam of that ſun, but as a branch of that root, but as a ſtream of that fountain.</p>
                  <p>For the third, how we muſt conform to this life? I anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us frame to our ſelves ſome Idea of Chriſt, let us ſet before us the life of Chriſt in the whole, and all the parts of it, as we find it recorded in God's Book. It would be a large picture if I ſhould draw it to the full, but for a taſte I ſhall give it in few lines. Now then ſetting aſide the conſideration of Chriſt as God, or as Mediator, or as Head of his Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:94897:129"/>1. I look at the mind of Chriſt, at his judgment, will, affections; ſuch as love, joy, delight, and the reſt; and eſpecially at the compaſſions of Jeſus Chriſt. O the dear affections, and compaſſions which Chriſt had towards the ſons of men! this was his errand from Heaven, and while he was upon the earth he was ever acting it, I mean his pitifulneſs,<note place="margin">Luke 4.18. Pſal. 147.3.</note> I mean his affections, and compaſſion <hi>in healing broken hearts;</hi> ſo the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds;</hi> it is ſpoken after the manner of a Chirurgion, he had a tender heart towards all broken hearts; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to put all broken bones into their native place again; nor ſpeak I thus only of him in reſpect of his office; but as he was man, he had in him ſuch <hi>a mind,</hi> that he could not but compaſſionate all in miſery; O what bowels! what ſtirrings, and boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and wreſtlings of a pained heart, touched with ſorrow, was ever, upon occaſion, in Jeſus Chriſt?<note place="margin">Matth. 14.1. Mark 6.34.</note> peruſe theſe texts, and <hi>Jeſus went forth, and ſaw a great multitude, and he was moved with compaſſion towards them, and he healed their ſick.—And Jeſus when he came out, ſaw much people, and was moved with compaſſion towards them, becauſe they were as ſheep not having a ſhepherd.<note place="margin">Mark 1.40, 41.</note>—And there came a leper to him, and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to him, and ſaying to him, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean, and Jeſus moved with compaſſion, put forth his hand, and touched him, ſaying, I will, be thou clean.—Then Jeſus called his diſciples unto him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 15.32.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſaid, I have compaſſion on the multitude.</hi> And for the two blind men that cried out, <hi>Have mercy on us O Lord, thou ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 20.34. Luke 15.20.</note> it is ſaid, that <hi>Jeſus ſtood ſtill,</hi>—and <hi>he had compaſſion on them, and touched their eyes.</hi> And the poor prodigal returning, <hi>When he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran and fell on his neck and kiſſed him.</hi> How ſweet is this laſt Inſtance! that our ſenſe of ſinful weakneſs, ſhould be ſorrow and pain to the bowels and heart of Jeſus Chriſt! you that are Parents of young Children, let me put the caſe; if ſome of you ſtanding in the relation of a Father, ſhould ſee his Child ſweat, and wreſtle under an over-load, till his back were almoſt broken, and that you ſhould hear him cry, <hi>Oh I am gone, I faint, I ſinck, I dye;</hi> would not your bowels be moved to pity? and would not your hands be ſtretched out to help? or if ſome of you ſtanding in the relation of a Mother, ſhould ſee your ſucking Child fallen into a pit, and wreſtling with the water, and crying for help, would you not ſtir, nor be moved in heart, nor run to deliver the Child from being drowned? Surely you would, and yet all this pity and compaſſion of yours is but as a ſhadow of the compaſſions and dear affections that were, and that are in the heart of Jeſus Chriſt; O he had a mind devoid of ſin, and therefore it could not but be full of pity, mercy, and tender bowels of compaſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I look at the grace in Chriſt; O he was full of grace, yea, full of all the graces of the Spirit;<note place="margin">Cant. 1.13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>A bundle of Mirrh, is my well-beloved to me:—My Beloved is unto me as a cluſter of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi:</hi> a bundle of Myrrh, and a cluſter of camphire denote all the graces of the Spirit; as many flowers are bound together in a noſegay, ſo the variety of the graces of the Spirit, concenter'd in the heart of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ex. gr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 21.5.</note>1. In him was meekneſs, <hi>He cometh unto thee meek:</hi> he had a ſweet command and moderation of his anger;<note place="margin">Num. 12.3.</note> he was meek as <hi>Moſes,</hi> nay, though <hi>Moſes</hi> was very meek, <hi>and very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the earth,</hi> yet Chriſt's meekneſs exceeded <hi>Moſe</hi>'s, as the body doth exceed the ſhadow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In him was humility, he ſaved not the world by his power, but by his humility; in his incarnation, Chriſt would be humble; and therefore he was born of a poor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in a common Inn; in his life, his way on earth was a continual lecture of humility; a little before his death he gave ſuch an example of humility as never was the like, <hi>He poured water into a baſon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 13.5.</note> 
                     <hi>and began to waſh the diſciples feet.</hi> O ye Apoſtles, why trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ye not at the wonderful ſight of this ſo great humility? <hi>Peter,</hi> what doſt thou? wilt thou ever yield that this Lord of Majeſty ſhould waſh thy feet? methinks I hear <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>What Lord, wilt thou waſh my feet? art not thou the Son of the living God? the Creator of the world, the beauty of the heavens; the Paradiſe of Angels, the Redeemer of men, the brightneſs of the Fathers glory? and I, what am I, but a worm, a clod of earth, a miſerable ſinner? and wilt thou notwithſtanding all this waſh my feet? leave Lord, O leave this baſe office for thy ſervants; lay down thy towel, and put on thy apparel again; beware that the heaven, or the Angels of heaven be not aſhamed of it, when they ſhall ſee that by this ceremony thou ſet'ſt them beneath the earth; take heed leaſt the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King Saul deſpiſe thee not, when ſhe ſhall ſee thee girded about with this towel, after the manner of a ſervant, and ſhall ſay, that ſhe will not take thee for her beloved, and much
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:94897:129"/> leſs for her God, whom ſhe ſeeth to attend upon ſo baſe an office.</hi> Thus may I imagine <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to beſpeak his Maſter, but he little knew what glory lay hid in this humility of Chriſt; it was for us, and our example; an humble Chriſt, to make humble Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In him was patience; O when I think of Chriſt's labours in preaching, wearineſs in travelling, watchfulneſs in praying, tears in compaſſionating, and then I add to all theſe his ſubmiſſion of Spirit, notwithſtanding all the affronts, injuries, and exprobrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men; how ſhould I but cry out, <hi>O the patience of Chriſt!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.23.</note> the Apoſtle tells us that <hi>when he was reviled, he reviled not again, when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi>—I have already given a touch of theſe graces in Chriſt, which now I may ſet before me.—In him was wiſdom, and knowledge, and juſtice, and mercy, and temperance, and fortitude, and every vertue, or every grace that poſſibly I can think of, <hi>A bundle of Myrrh is my Beloved unto me, as a cluſter of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I look at the converſation of Chriſt in word and deed; for his words, they were gracious. Not an idle word ever came out of the lips of Chriſt; himſelf tells us that <hi>of every idle word we muſt give an account;</hi> O then how free was Chriſt of every idle word?<note place="margin">Mat. 12.36.</note> he knew the times and ſeaſons when to ſpeak, and when to be ſilent; he weighed every word with every Circumſtance, time, and place, and manner, and matter;<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.7.</note> 
                     <hi>There's a time to keep ſilence, and a time to ſpeak,</hi> ſaid <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he returned again to his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and hence we read that ſometimes Jeſus being accuſed, <hi>he held his peace;</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

Let us look fixedly on Jeſus Chriſt, let us keep our ſpiritual eyes ſtill on the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, untill we feel our ſelves conforming to it: it is a true ſaying, that <hi>Objects and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reaſons kept much upon the mind by ſerious thoughts, are the great engine, both appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nature and grace, to turn about the ſoul of man.</hi> If I may deliver it in fewer terms, <hi>Objects conſidered much, or frequently, do turn the ſoul into their own nature.</hi> Such as the things are we muſt think of, and conſider of, ſuch will be our ſelves; or if we be not ſo, it is not through any imperfection in the object (eſpecially in ſuch an object as Jeſus Chriſt is) but becauſe it is not well applied, and by conſideration held upon the heart, till it may work there; indeed the manner of this working may be ſecret, and inſenſible, yet if we follow on, we ſhall feel it in the iſſue; the beholding of Chriſt is a powerful beholding; there is a changing, transforming vertue goes out of Chriſt, by looking on Chriſt; can we think of his humility, and not be humble? can we think of his meekneſs and gentleneſs of Spirit, and yet we continue in our fierceneſs, roughneſs, frowardneſs of Spirit? can a proud fierce heart apprehend a meek, and ſweet, and lowly Jeſus? no, no; the heart muſt be ſuitable to the thing apprehended, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible otherwiſe; certainly if the <hi>look</hi> be right, there muſt be a ſuitableneſs betwixt the heart and Chriſt. Sight works upon the imagination in brute creatures; as <hi>Laban</hi>'s Sheep, when they ſaw the party-coloured Rods, they had Lambs ſuitable; now will ſight work upon imagination, and imagination work a real change in nature? and is not the eye of the mind (eſpecially the eye of faith) more ſtrong and powerful? if I but write after a copy, I ſhall in a while learn to write like it, if I ſeriouſly meditate on any excellent ſubject, it will leave a print behind it on my ſpirit; if I read but the life and death of ſome eminently gracious and holy man, it molds, and faſhions, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, and conforms my mind to his ſimilitude; even ſo, and much more is it in this caſe; ſince the eye of faith works in the matter, which in it ſelf is operative and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and therefore it cannot but work more, than where is only ſimple imitation, or naked meditation; O then let us ſet the coppy of Chriſt's life (as before deſcribed) in our view, and let us look upon it with both eyes, with the eye of reaſon, and with the eye of faith.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhould we keep the eye of our faith on this bleſſed object, until we feel this conformity in us? I anſwer.—</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Be we aſſured that our prayer (if it be in faith) is even now heard; never any came to Chriſt with ſtrong expectations to receive grace, or any benefit prayed for, that was turned empty away; beſides Chriſt hath engaged himſelf by promiſe to write his Law in our hearts; to make us like himſelf; <hi>As he which hath called us is holy,</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. If notwithſtanding all this, we feel not for the preſent this conformity in us, at leaſt in ſuch a degree; let us act over the ſame particulars again and again; the gifts of grace are therefore communicated by degrees, that we might be taken off from living upon a received ſtock of grace; and that we might ſtill be running to the ſpring, and drink in there; why alas, we have a continual need of Chriſt's letting out himſelf, and grace into our hearts, and therefore we muſt wait at the well-head, Chriſt; we muſt look on Chriſt as appointed on purpoſe by his Father to be the Beginner and Finiſher of our holineſs; and we muſt believe that he will never leave that work imperfect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he is ordained of the Father. <hi>We may be confident</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in us, will perform it, or finiſh it, until the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6.

                  <p>I have now done with this ſubject: only before I finiſh, one word more.

I deny not other helps, but amongſt them all, if I would make choice which to fall upon, that I may become more and more holy, I would ſet before me this glaſs, <hi>(i.e.) Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>holy life,</hi> the great examplar of holineſs; we were at firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after his Image in holineſs, and this Image we loſt through our ſin, and to this Image we ſhould endeavour to be reſtored by imitation; And how ſhould this be done, but by looking on Chriſt as our pattern? by running through the ſeveral Ages of Chriſt, and by obſerving all his graces, and gracious actings? in this reſpect I charge thee, O my ſoul (for to what purpoſe ſhould I charge others, if I begin not at home, and with thee?) that thou make conſcience of this practical Evangelical duty; O be much in the exerciſe of it! not only in the day intend Chriſt, but when night comes, and thou lyeſt down on thy bed, let thy pillow be as Chriſt's boſom, in which <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was ſaid to lean; there lean thou with <hi>John;</hi> yea, lye thou between his breaſt; and <hi>Let them lye all night betwixt thy breaſts;</hi> thus mayeſt thou <hi>lye down in peace and ſleep,</hi>

                     <hi>and the Lord only will make thee to dwell in ſafety;</hi> and when day returns again, have this in mind, yea, in all thy thoughts, words, and deeds, even <hi>look unto Jeſus</hi> as thy holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amplar; Say to thy ſelf, <hi>If Chriſt my Saviour were now upon earth, would theſe be his thoughts, words, and deeds? would he be thus diſpoſed as I now feel my ſelf? would he ſpeak theſe words that I am now uttering? would he do this that I am now putting my hand unto? O let me not yield my ſelf to any thought, word, or action, which my dear Jeſus would be aſhamed to own!</hi> yea (if it were poſſible for thee to be ſo conſtant in this bleſſed duty) going and ſtanding, ſitting and lying, eating and drinking, ſpeaking and holding thy peace, by thy ſelf or in company, caſt an eye upon Jeſus; for by this means thou canſt not chuſe but love him more, and joy in him more, and truſt in him more, and be more and more familiar with him, and draw more and more grace and vertue, and ſweetneſs from him; O let this be thy wiſdom, to think much of Chriſt; ſo as to provoke thee to the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:94897:132"/> imitation of Chriſt! then ſhalt thou learn to contemn the world, to do good to all, to injure no man, to ſuffer wrong patiently, yea, to pray for all thoſe that deſpightfully uſe thee, and perſecute thee; then ſhalt thou learn to condeſcend to the weak, to condole ſinners caſes, to embrace the penitent, to obey Superiours, to miniſter to all; then ſhalt thou learn to avoid all boaſting, bragging, ſcandal, immoderate eating and drinking; in a word, all ſin. Then ſhalt thou learn to <hi>bear about in thy body the dying of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that the life alſo of Jeſus may be made manifeſt in thy body:</hi> So the Apoſtle, <hi>For we which live are alwayes delivered unto death for Jeſus ſake, that the life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our mortal fleſh,</hi> 2 Corinth. 4.10, 11. Why this is to follow Chriſt's ſteps, he deſcended from heaven to earth for thy ſake; do thou trample on earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, <hi>Seek after the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs,</hi> for thy own ſake; though the world be ſweet, yet Chriſt is ſweeter; though the world prove bitter, yet Chriſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained the bitterneſs of it for thee: and now he ſpeaks to thee, as he did to <hi>Peter, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, James,</hi> and <hi>John, Come, follow me;</hi> O do not faint in the way, leſt thou loſe thy place in thy Country, that Kingdom of glory.</p>
                  <q>Thus far we have <hi>looked on Jeſus</hi> as our <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his life, during the whole time of his Miniſtry; our next work is to <hi>look on Jeſus,</hi> carrying on the great work of man's ſalvation, during the time of his ſuffering and dying on the croſs, until his reſurrection from the dead.</q>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Son of Righteouſneſs, that <hi>aroſe with healing,</hi> we ſhall now ſee go down in a ruddy Cloud. And in this Piece, as in the former, we muſt firſt lay down the Object, and then direct you to <hi>look upon it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Object is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> carrying on the work of mans Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation during the time of his Sufferings; now in all the tranſactions of this life, we ſhall obſerve them, as they were carried on ſucceſſively in thoſe few hours of his Paſſion and death.</p>
                  <p>As this work of mans ſalvation was great, ſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve how every piece of it was carried on in its due time, even from eternity to eternity. The very time of Chriſt's paſſage depended not on the will of man; for his enemies ſought many a time before to ſlay him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Herod</hi> in his Infancy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.16. The Jews in his riper age, when ſometimes they took up ſtones to ſtone him, <hi>John</hi> 8.59. and ſometimes they would have broke his neck from an hill, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.29: but his time was not then come. We read of the Paſchal Lamb, that it was to be ſlain <hi>on the fourteenth day of the firſt Moneth called Abib,</hi> or <hi>Niſan:</hi>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:94897:133"/> a Month, as when light prevails againſt darkneſs, and every thing revives and ſprings; ſo Chriſt by his ſufferings was to chaſe away our darkneſs and death, and to bring in light and life, and a bleſſed ſpring of Grace and Glory; and as it was to be ſlain <hi>in the evening,</hi> or <hi>between the evening;</hi> ſo muſt Chriſt the true Paſchal Lamb be ſacrificed about the very ſame hour that the Myſtical Lamb was ſlain: to underſtand which, we muſt know, that the Jews diſtinguiſhed their Artificial day into four parts; from ſix to nine, from nine to twelve, from twelve to three, from three to eight; this laſt part was counted the Evening of the Day, and the next three hours the Evening of the Night; now in this laſt part of the Day uſed the Paſchal Lamb to be ſlain; and after it was ſlain, ſome time was taken up to dreſs it whole for Supper; ſo Chriſt at the fourth part of the day, at their nineth hour, that is, at our three of the Clock in the afternoon, <hi>between the Evenings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 27.50.</note> 
                     <hi>with a loud voice yielded up the Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the whole time of theſe laſt and extream ſufferings of Chriſt, I ſhall reduce them to ſomewhat leſs than one natural day; or if we may take the whole day before us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of twenty four hours, and begin with the Evening, according to the beginning of natural dayes from the Creation (as it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.5.</note> 
                     <hi>the evening and the morning made the firſt day</hi>). In this revolution of time, I ſhall obſerve theſe ſeveral paſſages.— As.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. About ſix in the Evening Chriſt celebrated, and eat the Paſsover with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, at which time he inſtituted the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and this continued till the eighth hour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. About Eight in the Evening he waſhed his Diſciples feet, and then leaning on the Table, he pointed out <hi>Judas</hi> that ſhould betray him; and this continued until the nineth hour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. About Nine in the Evening (the ſecond Watch in the night) <hi>Judas</hi> that Traytor, went from the Diſciples; and in the mean time Chriſt made that ſpiritual Sermon, and afterwards that ſpiritual Prayer recited only by <hi>John;</hi> John 14, 15, 16, 17 chapt. and this, (together with a Pſalm they ſung) continued at leaſt until the tenth hour. Thus far we proceeded before we had done with the <hi>Life of Chriſt.</hi> That which concerns his Paſſion, follows immediately upon this; and upon that only I ſhall take notice in my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>This Paſſion of Chriſt I ſhall divide between the night and day. 1. For the night, and his ſufferings therein, we may obſerve theſe periods, or thereabouts. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From ten to twelve he goes over the Brook <hi>Cedron</hi> to the Garden of <hi>Gethſemani,</hi> where he prayed earneſtly, and ſweat water and blood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From twelve till three he is betrayed, and by the ſouldiers and other Officers, he is bound, and brought to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and carried into the houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> who was one of the chief Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From three till ſix, they led him from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> when he and all the Prieſts of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſate upon Jeſus Chriſt; and there it was that <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, and at laſt the whole <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> gave their conſent to Chriſt's Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Night thus diſpatcht, at ſix in the morning, about ſun-riſing, our Saviour was brought unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> hanged himſelf, becauſe he had betrayed innocent Blood.—About ſeven in the ſame morning Chriſt is carried to <hi>Herod,</hi> that cruel Tyrant, who the year before had put <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt to death.—At eight of the ſame day our Saviour Chriſt is returned to <hi>Pilate,</hi> who propounded to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would have <hi>Jeſus</hi> or <hi>Barabbas</hi> let looſe unto them.—About the ninth, (which the Jews call the third hour of the day) Chriſt was whipped, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Thorns. About ten, <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> brought forth Jeſus out of the Common Hall, ſaying, <hi>Behold the man;</hi> and then in the place called <hi>Gabbatha,</hi> he publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Chriſt to be Crucified. About eleven our Saviour carried his Croſs, and was brought to the place called <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where he was faſtned on the Croſs, and lifted up, <hi>as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs.</hi>—About twelve (in that Meridian which the Jews call the ſixth hour) that ſupernatural Eclipſe of the Sun happened.—And about three in the afternoon (which the Jews call the nineth hour) the Sun now beginning to receive his Light, Chriſt cried, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> and commending his Spirit into his Fathers hands, he gave up the Ghoſt.—I ſhall add to theſe; that about four in the Afternoon, our bleſſed Saviour was pierced with a Spear, and there iſſued out of his ſide both Blood and Water.—And about five (which the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:94897:133"/> Jews call the eleventh, and the laſt hour of the day) he was buried by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus.</hi>—So that in this round of our natural day, you ſee the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tranſaction of Chriſt's ſufferings. I ſhall take them in order, and begin with his ſufferings in that night before his crucifying. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto his Diſciples,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 21.31. Mark 16.30.</note> 
                     <hi>all ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night:</hi> and he ſaid unto <hi>Peter, that this day, even in this night, before the Cock crow twice, thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Of the Brook over which Chriſt paſſed.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt paſſage of that <hi>Night,</hi> was Chriſt's going over the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> to the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane. When Jeſus had ſpoken theſe words, he went forth with his Diſciples over the Brook Cedron, where was a Garden, into which he entred,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 18.1.</note> 
                     <hi>and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this paſſage obſerve we theſe Particulars. 1. The River over which they paſſed. 2. The Garden into which they entred. 3. The Prayer he there made, and the dolours and agonies he there ſuffered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He and his Diſciples went over the Brook <hi>Cedron.</hi> So it was called (ſay ſome) from the ſame Cedars that grew all along the Banks; or (ſay others) from the darkneſs of the Valley, ſo <hi>Kader</hi> ſignifies darkneſs; and this was done to fulfil a Propheſie;<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.7.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſhall drink of the Brook in the way.</hi> By the <hi>Brook</hi> or Torrent, we may underſtand myſtically the wrath of God, and the rage of men, the very afflictions, which befell Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: and by his <hi>drinking of the Brook,</hi> we may underſtand Chriſt enduring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, or (as others) his enduring many afflictions, and not a few. 1. That <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> are underſtood by <hi>waters,</hi> we find it very frequently in Scriptures;<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.4. Pſal. 42.7. Pſal. 69.1. Pſal. 124.1, 4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me, and the floods of Belial made me afraid.—Deep calleth unto deep, at the noiſe of the water ſpouts, all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</hi>—And, <hi>Save me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my ſoul;</hi> and, <hi>if it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide,—then the waters had overwhelmed us, the ſtream had gone over our ſoul, then the proud waters had gone over our ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As waters ſignifie afflictions; ſo Chriſt drinking of thoſe waters, it ſignified <hi>Chriſt's ſuffering of afflictions;</hi> or as others, it ſignifies <hi>Chriſt's ſuffering of many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Thus we find together two words with relation thereunto, <hi>are ye able to drink of the cup</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that I ſhall drink of,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 20.22.</note> 
                     <hi>and to be baptized with the Baptiſm that I am baptized with?</hi> He that drinketh, hath the water in him, and he that is baptized, dipped, or plunged, hath the water about him; ſo it notes the variety or univerſality of afflictions which Chriſt ſuffered; it was within him, and it was about him, he was every way afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Not to ſpeak yet of thoſe ſufferings, which yet we are not come to ſpeak unto; we find here in the way, betwixt the City and the Garden, that Chriſt went over the Brook <hi>Cedron;</hi> in the night he wades through cold waters on bare feet; and as he wades through them, he drinks of them, he doth not ſip, but drink; <hi>he ſhall drink of the Brook in the way.</hi> I know ſome would not have this Propheſie accompliſhed till afore Chriſt's apprehenſion, when it is ſaid that the rude rout brought him again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> over the Brook <hi>Cedron;</hi> and then he drunk of the Brook; but I find no mention of this Brook in Scripture at ſuch a time; only now <hi>in this way,</hi> I find theſe paſſages. 1. His Conference with his Diſciples as they go along. 2. The Diſciples reply upon his Conference. 3. His dolorous paſſage over the Brook, betokening the very wrath of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the way<note n="†" place="margin">Vid. Arot. in locum. <hi>Mat. 26.30, 36</hi>
                     </note> he hath a ſerious conference with his diſciples: ſo the Evangeliſt; <hi>and when they had ſung an hymne, they went out towards the mount of Olives, and then ſaith Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto them, all ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night; for it is written, I will ſmite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be ſcattered abroad.</hi> Chriſt now begins the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Paſſion; <hi>the ſhepherd ſhall be ſmitten;</hi> and he proves it from Gods Decree, and from the Propheſie of the Prophet, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7.<note place="margin">Zech. 13.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Awake, O Sword, againſt my ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and againſt the man that is my fellow.—Smite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered abroad.</hi> God the Father is here brought in, as drawing and whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Sword, and calling upon it, to do execution againſt Jeſus Chriſt; God the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:94897:134"/> Father had an hand in the ſufferings; <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10.</note>—<hi>I will ſmite the ſhepherd,</hi> ſaith God; it was not a naked permiſſion, but a poſitive decree, and actual providence of God that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer; the plot was long ſince drawn, and lay hid in Gods boſom, till he was pleaſed by the actions of men to copy it out, and to give the world a draught of it. This was not a thing of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; no, no; God ſpent his eternal thoughts about it; the Story was long ſince writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Zecharie</hi>'s Book,<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.8. Acts 2.23.</note> and in the <hi>Volume of Gods Book;</hi> Chriſt was ordained to be a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world; <hi>him being delivered by the determinate council and fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain:</hi> the enemies of Chriſt, though they broke Commands, yet they fulfilled Decrees.<note place="margin">Acts 4.27, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Against thy holy Child Jeſus whom thou haſt anoynted, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and people of Iſrael were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy councel determined before to be done.</hi> The Story of Chriſt's ſufferings was long ſince taken up, and reſolved on in the Councils of Heaven; and now in the way <hi>the only begotten Son which lay in the boſom of his Father,</hi> reveals this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he tells his Diſciples, <hi>It is written, it is written, I will ſmite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be ſcattered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Diſciples hearing this diſcovery of <hi>the ſhepherd being ſmitten, and the ſheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcattered,</hi> they are amazed; what ſhall Chriſt die? and ſhall we like cowards run away, and leave him alone in the combat? <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſeems boldeſt, he ſpeaks firſt; <hi>Though all men ſhall be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended.</hi> O raſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption! It appears in theſe particulars;—1. <hi>Peter</hi> prefers himſelf before the reſt, as if all the other Diſciples had been weak, and he only ſtrong; <hi>though all ſhould be offended, yet will not I.</hi> 2. <hi>Peter</hi> contradicts Chriſt's great diſcovery of his Fathers great deſign from all eternity, with a few bragging words; <hi>q. d.</hi> what though <hi>Zechary</hi> hath ſaid it, and God hath decreed it, yet on my part, I will never do it; <hi>Though I ſhould die with thee, I will not deny thee.</hi> 3. <hi>Peter</hi> in his boaſt never mentions <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>help,</hi> or God's aſſiſtance; whereas in relation to future promiſes, and future purpoſes, the Apoſtles Rule is,<note place="margin">Jam. 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>ye ought to ſay, if the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this, and that:</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have ſaid, <hi>by God's aſſiſtance I will not be offended; by the Lord</hi>'s <hi>help, I will not deny thee; if the Lord will, I will do this and that; I will live with thee, and die with thee, rather than I will deny thee;</hi> but we find no ſuch word in all the Story; and therefore Chriſt takes him off his bottoms in the firſt place;<note place="margin">Mat. 26.35.</note> 
                     <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee Peter, that this night before the Cock crow twice, thou ſhalt deny me thrice:</hi> Oh no, ſaith <hi>Peter;</hi> he will not go off his preſumptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; <hi>though I ſhould die with thee, I will not deny thee; likewiſe alſo ſaid all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> But I muſt not dwell on theſe paſſages.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His dolorous paſſage over the Brook ſucceeds; <hi>He went forth with his Diſciples over the Brook Cedron:</hi> I never read of this Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> but ſome way or other it points at the ſufferings of our Saviour; I ſhall inſtance in ſome places. 1.

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:94897:134"/> All the difference that I find betwixt <hi>Shimei</hi> and Chriſt in this, is, in that <hi>Shimei</hi> was but a wicked man, and yet he died an honourable death, not for his ſervants, but for his own tranſgreſſion; but Chriſt, being a juſt man (ſo <hi>Pilate</hi>'s wife ſent her Husband word, <hi>Have thou nothing to do with that juſt man</hi>) he died a moſt ignominious ſhameful death, even the death of the Croſs, and that not for himſelf, but for us;<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.5.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. It reproves.

Surely this world is no place, and this life it is no time for pleaſure; God hath not caſt man out of Paradiſe, that he ſhould find another Paradiſe on this ſide heaven. Oh why do we ſeek the living among the dead? Why do we ſeek for living comforts, where we muſt expect to die daily? it is only heaven that is above all winds, and ſtorms and tempeſts, and ſeas, and brooks, and waves: Oh why do we look for joyes in a vale of tears?

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 16.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee;</hi> but Jeſus thereupon calls him <hi>Satan,</hi> meaning that no greater contradictions can be offered to the deſigns of God and Chriſt, than to diſwade us from ſufferings. There's too much of <hi>Peter</hi>'s humour abides amongſt us: Oh this Doctrine of afflictions will not down with <hi>Libertines, Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the like; and hence we believe we have our Congregations ſo thin in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of ſome of theirs; they that can break off the yoke of Obedience, and untie the Bands of Diſcipline, and preach a cheap Religion, and preſent heaven in the midſt of flowers, and ſtrew palms and carpets in the way, and offer great liberty of living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin, and reconcile eternity with the preſent enjoyment, ſhall have their Schools filled with Diſciples; but they that preach the Croſs, and ſufferings, and afflictions, and ſtrictneſs of an holy life, they ſhall have the lot of their bleſſed Lord, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> they ſhall be ill thought of, and deſerted, and railed againſt. Well, but if this be the way that Chriſt hath led us, whileſt others abide at eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> let us follow him in the valley, and over the Brook that is called <hi>Cedron.</hi>

                     <hi>Jeſus went forth with his Diſciples over the Brook Cedron, where was a Garden;</hi> many Myſteries are included in this Word; and I believe it is not without reaſon, that our Saviour goes into <hi>a Garden.</hi> As,—1. Becauſe Gardens are ſolitary places fit for meditation and prayer; to this end we find Chriſt ſometimes on a Mountain, and ſometimes in a Garden. 2. Becauſe Gardens are places fit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſt, when Chriſt was weary with preaching, working of Miracles, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acts of Grace in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then he retires into this Garden. 3. Becauſe a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den was the place wherein we fell, and therefore Chriſt made choice of a Garden, to begin there the greateſt work of our Redemption: In the firſt Garden was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all evils, and in this garden was the beginning of our reſtitution from all evils; in the firſt Garden, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was overthrown by Satan, and in this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> overcame, and Satan himſelf was by him overcome; in the firſt Garden ſin was contracted, and we were indebted by our ſins to God; and in this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſin was paid for, by that great and precious price of the blood of God: in the firſt Garden man ſurfeited by eating the forbidden fruit; and in this Garden Chriſt ſweat it out wonderfully, even by a bloody ſweat: in the firſt Garden, Death firſt made its entrance into the world; and in this Garden Life enters to reſtore us from Death to Life again: in the firſt Garden <hi>Adam</hi>'s Liberty to ſin brought himſelf and all us into bondage; and in this Garden, Chriſt being bound and fettered, we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by freed and reduced to liberty. I might thus deſcant in reſpect of every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but this is the ſum; in a Garden firſt begun our ſin, and in this Garden firſt began the Paſſion, that great Work and Merit of our Redemption. 4. Chriſt goes
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:94897:135"/> eſpecially into this Garden, that his enemies might the more eaſily find him out; the Evangeliſt tells us, that this Garden was a place often frequented by Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that <hi>Judas, which betrayed him, knew the place,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 18.2.</note> 
                     <hi>for Jeſus oftentimes reſorted thither with his Diſciples;</hi> ſure then he went not thither to hide himſelf, but rather to expoſe himſelf; and like a noble Champion, to appear firſt in the field, and to expect his enemies. Thus it appears to all the world, that Chriſt's death was voluntary. <hi>He poured forth his ſoul unto death</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>he gave himſelf for our ſins</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) nay,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.12.

                  <p n="1">1. He betakes himſelf to his great Antidote, which, himſelf, the great Phyſitian of our ſouls, preſcribed to all the world; he <hi>prayes</hi> to his heavenly Father; he kneels down; and not only ſo, but falls flat upon the ground; he prayes with an intention great as his ſorrow, and yet with a ſubmiſſion ſo ready,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> as if the Cup had been the moſt indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing in the world. The Form of his Prayer ran thus, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let this Cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> In this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obſerve we theſe Particulars: 1. The perſon to whom he prayes, <hi>O my Father.</hi> 2. The matter for which he prayes; <hi>Let this Cup paſs from me.</hi> 3. The Limitation of this Prayer; <hi>If it be poſſible,</hi> and <hi>if it be thy will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Perſon to whom he prayes; it is his <hi>Father:</hi> As Chriſt prayed not in his Godhead, but according to his Manhood, ſo neither prayed he to himſelf as God; but to the <hi>Father,</hi> the firſt perſon of the God-head: Hence ſome obſerve, that as the Father ſometimes ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> he ſpake not to himſelf, but to the Son; ſo the Son uſually ſaying, <hi>O my Father,</hi> he prayes not to himſelf, but to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the Matter of his Prayer: <hi>Let this Cup paſs from me:</hi> Some interpret thus; <hi>Let this Cup paſs by me, Oh that I might not taſte it!</hi> But others thus; <hi>Let this Cup paſs from me; though I muſt taſte it, yet Oh that I may not be</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Quod dicit, transfer cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem iſtum a me, non hoc eſt, non adveniat mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi; niſi enim advenerit, transferri non poterit, ſed ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut quod prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit, nec in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tactum eſt, noc permanens; ſic Salvator levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter invadentem tentationem flagitat pelli. <hi>Sic Dioniſius Alexandrin.</hi> Heb. <hi>5.7.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>too long, or tediouſly annoyed by it!</hi> That which leads unto this laſt interpretation is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh offered up Prayers and Supplications with ſtrong cries and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and he was heard in that which he feared,</hi> Heb. 5.7. How was he heard? not in the removal of the Cup; for he drank it up all: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the tedious annoyance or poyſoning of the Cup; for though it made him ſweat drops of blood, though it grieved him, and pained him, and made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Though it caſt him into a ſleep, and laid him dead in his Grave, and there ſealed him for a time; yet preſently within the ſpace of forty hours, or thereabouts, he revived, and awakened as a Lion out of ſleep, or as a Giant refreſhed with wine; and ſo it paſſed from him, as he prayed, in a very ſhort time, and by that ſhort and momentary death, he purchaſed to his people everlaſting Life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Limitation of his Prayer; <hi>If it be poſſible, if it be thy will:</hi> He knows what is his Fathers will, and he prayes accordingly, and is willing to ſubmit unto it: if the <hi>paſſing of the Cup</hi> be according to the laſt interpretation, we ſhall need none of theſe many diſtinctions to reconcile the will of God and Chriſt: <hi>If it be poſſible,</hi> ſignifies the earneſtneſs of the Prayer: and <hi>if it be thy will,</hi> the ſubmiſſion of Chriſt unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Prayer is ſhort but ſweet: How many things needful to a Prayer do we find concentred in this one inſtance? Here is Humility of Spirit, Lowlineſs of Deportment, Importunity of Deſire, a Fervent Heart, a Lawful Matter, and a Reſignation to the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:94897:136"/> will of God. Some think this the moſt fervent prayer that ever Chriſt made on earth; <hi>If it be poſſible, O! if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me:</hi> And I think it was the greateſt dereliction and ſubmiſſion to the will of God, that ever was found upon the earth, for whether the Cup might paſs or not paſs, he leaves it to his Father; <hi>neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt, q. d.</hi> Though in this Cup are many Ingredients, it is full red, and hath in it many dregs, and I know I muſt drink, and ſuck out the very utmoſt dreg, yet whether it ſhall paſs from me in that ſhort time, or continue with me a long long time, I leave it to thy will: I ſee in reſpect of my humanity, there is in me fleſh and blood, O! I am frail and weak; I cannot but fear the wrath of God, and therefore I pray thus earneſtly to my God; <hi>O, my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what was there in the Cup, that made Chriſt pray thus earneſtly that it might paſs from him? I anſwer,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The great pain that he muſt endure; the buffettings, whippings, bleedings, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying; all the torments from firſt to laſt throughout all his body: why all theſe now came into his mind, and all theſe were put into the Cup of which he muſt drink.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The great ſhame that he muſt undergo, this was more than pain: as <hi>a good name is better than precious Oyntment, and loving favour better than ſilver and Gold;</hi> ſo is ſhame a greater puniſhment to the mind, than any torture can be to the fleſh. Now came into his thoughts his apprehending, binding, judging, ſcorning, reviling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning; and Oh what a bloody bluſh comes into the face of Chriſt, whilſt in the cup he ſees theſe Ingredients!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The neglect of men, notwithſtanding both his pain and ſhame: I look upon this as a greater cut to the heart of Chriſt than both the former: when he conſidered, that after all his ſufferings and reproaches, few would regard, O this was a bitter Ingredient! naturally men deſire, if they cannot be delivered, yet to be pittied; it is a kind of eaſe, even to find ſome regard among the Sons of men; it ſhews that they wiſh us well, and that they would give us eaſe if they could; but Oh when it comes to this, that a poor wretch is under many ſufferings, and great ſhame, and that he finds none ſo much as to regard all this, now verily it is an heavy caſe; and hence was Chriſt's Complaint: <hi>Have ye no regard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>O all ye that paſs by the way? Conſider, and behold, if ever there were ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which was done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the dayes of his fierce anger.</hi> Chriſt complains not of the ſharp pains he endured, but he complains of this, <hi>Have ye no regard?</hi> He cries not out, <hi>Oh deliver me and ſave me;</hi> but <hi>Oh conſider and regard me; q. d.</hi> All that I ſuffer I am contented with, I regard it not; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this troubles me, that you will not regard: why, it is for you that I endure all this; and do you ſo look upon it, as if it nothing at all concerned you? Suppoſe a Prince ſhould pay ſome mighty price to redeem a ſlave from death, and the ſlave ſhould grow ſo deſperate, as after the price paid, to throw himſelf upon his death, yea, with all the ſtrength and might he hath, to offer a death upon his very Redeemer, would not this trouble? Why, thus it was; Chriſt is willing to redeem us with his own precious blood,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.29.</note> but he ſaw many to paſs by without any regard, yea, ready to trample his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood under their feet, and <hi>to account the blood of the Covenant as an unholy thing:</hi> Oh this was another Spear in the heart of Chriſt, or a bitter Ingredient in this Cup.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Guilt of ſin which he was now to undergo; <hi>upon him was laid the iniquity of us all.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.6.</note> All the ſins of all Believers in the world, from the firſt Creation, to the laſt Judgment, were laid on him: Oh what a weight was this! Surely one ſin is like a Talent of Lead; Oh then what were ſo many thouſands of millions? The very earth it ſelf groans under the weight of ſin until this day. <hi>David</hi> cried out, that <hi>his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were a burden too heavy for him to bear:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.4. Amos. 2.13.</note> Nay, God himſelf complains, <hi>Behold, I am preſſed under you, as a Cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaves.</hi> Now then, no wonder if Chriſt bearing all the ſins of Jews and Gentiles, bond and free, cry out, <hi>My Soul is heavy;</hi> for ſin was heavy on his ſoul.—In that I ſay, all the ſins of all Believers were laid on Chriſt, underſtand me ſoberly; my meaning is not that Believers ſins were ſo laid on Chriſt, as that they ceaſed to be Believers ſins according to their phyſical and real in-dwelling, but only that they were laid on Chriſt by Law-imputation, or by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal-obligation to ſatisfactory puniſhment. I make a difference betwixt ſin, and the guilt of ſin; for ſin it ſelf is <hi>macula,</hi> the blot, the defilement, and blackneſs of ſin, which I conceive, is nothing but the abſence and privation of that moral rectitude and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:94897:136"/> which the Law requireth: but the guilt of Sin is ſomewhat iſſuing from this blot and blackneſs, according to which the Perſon is liable and obnoxious to eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some indeed give a diſtinction of the guilt of ſin; there is <hi>reatus culpae,</hi> the guilt of ſin, as ſin, and this is all one with ſin, being the very eſſence, ſoul, and formal being of ſin; they call it a fundamental, or potential guilt; and there is <hi>reatus poenae, reatus perſonae, reatus actualis,</hi> the guilt or obligation to puniſhment, the actual guilt, or actual obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon who hath thus ſinned to puniſhment; and this guilt is a thing far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from ſin it ſelf, and is ſeparable from ſin: yea, and is removed from ſin in our juſtification. Now this was the ſin or guilt, which was laid on Chriſt, in which ſenſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24. Iſa. 53.6. 2 Cor. 5.21.</note> how bare our ſins on the Tree, but by his ſufferings?—<hi>And he hath laid on him the iniquity of us all?</hi>—how laid on him, but by imputation?—<hi>And he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin;</hi> how made ſin for us? ſurely there was in Chriſt no fundamental guilt; no, no, but he was made Sin by imputation and Law-account: he was our ſurety, and ſo our ſins were laid on him in order to puniſhment, as if now in the Garden, he had ſaid to his Father, <hi>Thou haſt given me a Body, as I have taken the debts and ſins of all believers in the world upon me: Come now, and arreſt me as the only pay-Maſter; lo here I am to do and ſuffer for their ſins, whatſoever thou pleaſeſt,</hi> Pſal. 40.6, 7, 8. Heb. 10.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Or, as if he had ſaid to his Father thus, <hi>I am the ſinner, O Father! I am the ſurety, all my friends wants, and all their debts, let them be laid on me; my life for their life, my ſoul for their ſouls, my glory for their glory, my heaven for their heaven:</hi> Now this was no ſmall matter; little do we know or conſider, what is the weight and guilt of ſin. And this was another ingredient, in Chriſts Cup.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Power and malice of Satan; the devill had a full leave and licenſe; not as it was with <hi>Job; Do what thou wilt, Satan, but ſave his life;</hi> no, no, he had a commiſſion without any ſuch reſtriction or limitation; the whole power of darkneſs was let looſe to uſe all his violence, and to afflict him as far as poſſibly he could; and this our Saviour intimates, when he ſaith; <hi>that the Prince of this world cometh:</hi> Now was it that the Word muſt be accompliſhed, <hi>Thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.30. Gen. 3.15.</note> the Devil could go no higher than the heel of Chriſt; but whatever he could do, he was ſure to do; he had been nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a great while at his heel; no ſooner he was born, but he would have killed him; and after he fell fiercely on him in the Wilderneſs, but now all the Power and all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of hell conjoynes. If we look on the Devil in reſpect of his evil nature, he is compared to <hi>a roaring Lion:</hi> not only is he a Lion, but a roaring Lion; his diſpoſition to do miſchief, is alwayes wound up to the height: and if we look on the Devil in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Power, there is no part of our ſouls or bodies that he cannot reach; the Apoſtle diſcribing his Power, he gives him names above the higheſt compariſons; as <hi>Principalities, Powers, Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, Spiritual wickedneſs above:</hi> Devils are not only called <hi>Princes,</hi> but <hi>Principalities;</hi> not only mighty, but <hi>Powers;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 6.12.</note> not only Rulers of a part, but of <hi>all the darkneſs of all this World;</hi> not only wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs;</hi> not only about us, but <hi>above us:</hi> they hang over our heads continually; you know what a diſadvantage it is to have your enemy get the hill, the upper ground; and this they have naturally, and alwayes. Oh then what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate muſt this be when all the Power, and all the malice of all the Devils in hell, ſhould by the permiſſion of God, arm themſelves againſt the Son of God. Surely this was a bitter Ingredient in Chriſt's Cup.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The wrath of God himſelf; this, above all, was the moſt bitter Dreg; it lay in the bottom, and Chriſt muſt drink it alſo: <hi>Oh the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger;</hi> God afflicts ſome in mercy, and ſome in anger, this was in his anger;<note place="margin">Lam. 1.12.</note> and yet in his anger God is not like to all; ſome he afflicts in his more gentle and mild, others in his fierce anger; this was in the very fierceneſs of his anger It is agreed upon by all Divines, that now Chriſt ſaw himſelf bearing the ſins of all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſtanding before the judgment-ſeat of God; to this end are thoſe words,<note place="margin">John 12.31.</note>

                     <hi>Then ſaith he unto them, my ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful even unto death.</hi> Ah Chriſtians! who can ſpeak out this ſorrow? <hi>The Spirit of a man will ſuſtain his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.14.</note> but a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> Chriſt's ſoul is ſorrowful; or if that be too flat, his ſoul is ſorrowful, <hi>exceeding ſorrowful;</hi> or if that language be too low, his ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, <hi>even unto death;</hi> not only extenſively, ſuch as muſt continue for the ſpace of ſeventeen or eighteen hours, even until death it ſelf ſhould finiſh it; but alſo intenſively, ſuch, and ſo great, as that which is uſed to be at the very point of death; and ſuch as were able to bring death it ſelf, had not Chriſt been reſerved to a greater and an heavier puniſhment. Of this ſorrow is that eſpecially ſpoken, <hi>conſider, and behold, if ever there were ſorrow like unto my ſorrow:</hi> Many a ſad and ſorrowful ſoul hath no queſtion been in the world; but the like ſorrow to this was never ſince the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the very terms of the Evangeliſts ſpeak no leſs; he was <hi>ſorrowful and heavy,</hi> ſaith one: <hi>amazed and very heavy,</hi> ſaith another: <hi>in an Agony,</hi> ſaith a third: <hi>in a ſoul trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> ſaith a fourth.

O then, how was that face disfigured, when it ſtood all on drops, and thoſe drops, not of a watry ſweat, but of a gore blood? We ſee in other men, that when they are diſquieted with fear or grief, the blood uſually runs to the heart; indeed that is the principal member, and therefore, leaving the other parts, it goes thither, as of choice, to comfort that; but our ſweet Saviour contrariwiſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would ſuffer without any manner of comfort) he denies to himſelf this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon relief of nature; all the Powers of our ſouls, and parts of our bodies were ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſin, and therefore he ſweats blood from every part; we ſin, and our eyes will ſcarce drop a tear for ſin; but his eyes, and ears, and head, and hands, and feet, and heart, and all run rivers of tears of blood for us, even for our ſins.—Let Jeſuites and Friers in meditating of Chriſt's ſufferings, cry out againſt the Jews; in this bloody ſweat of Chriſt I ſee another uſe; alas! here's no <hi>Jew,</hi> no <hi>Judas,</hi> no <hi>Herod,</hi> no <hi>Pilate,</hi> no Scribe, no Phariſees? here's no tormentors to whip him; no ſouldiers to crown his Head with thrones, here's neither nailes, nor ſpear to fetch his blood out of his Body; how comes it then to paſs?

I will not ſay but that every drop of Chriſt's blood was very precious, and of ſufficient value to ſave a world; but certainly, that blood which was not forc'd by whips, or thorns, or ſpear, is to be had in ſingular honour; as the myrrhe, that by inciſion of the Tree, flows out, is very precious; yet that which drops out of its own accord, is accounted as the firſt and choyce; and as the Balſome, which way ſoever it come, is ſweet; yet that which falls of its own accord, is held the moſt pure and odoriferous: to this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes that Apocryphal-ſaying in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, I gave a ſweet ſmell like Cinamon, and I yielded a pleaſant odour,</hi>

                  <p>BY this time the Traitor <hi>Judas</hi> was arrived at <hi>Gethſemani,</hi> and being near the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-door, Jeſus goes to his Diſciples, and calls them from their ſleep; by an <hi>Irony</hi> (as ſome think) he bids them <hi>ſleep on now, and take their reſt;</hi> meaning if they could for danger,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.45, 46.</note> that now was near; but withal he adds, <hi>Behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of ſinners; riſe, let us be going, behold he is at hand that doth betray me.</hi> That it might appear he undertook his ſufferings with choice and free election, he not only refuſed to fly, but he calls his Apoſtles to riſe, that they might meet his Murderers. And now they come <hi>with Swords and Staves;</hi> or as <hi>John</hi> adds,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.47. John 18.3. Ioh. 18.12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>with Lanthorns and Torches, and</hi> (Judas <hi>going before them, and drawing near unto Jeſus to kiſs him) they took him, and bound him, and led him away to</hi> Annas <hi>firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Period I ſhall obſerve, 1. <hi>Judas</hi>'s Treaſon. 2. Chriſt's Apprehenſion. 3. Chriſt's binding. 4. Chriſt's leading to <hi>Annas,</hi> one of the Chief Prieſts, as to his firſt ſtation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Judas</hi>'s treaſon: <hi>And while he yet ſpake, behold a multitude, and he that was
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:94897:138"/> called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto</hi> Jeſus <hi>to kiſs him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 22.47.</note> This Traitor is not a Diſciple only, but an Apoſtle; not one of the ſeventy, but one of the twelve. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks of many offices of Love that Chriſt had done to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> in eſpecial manner; he had called him to be an Apoſtle, made him his Friend, his Familiar, cauſed him to eat of his Bread, ſit at his Table, and to dip his hand in the Diſh with him; yea if his Tradition be true, Jeſus <hi>had delivered</hi> Judas <hi>often from death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>Serm 28.</hi> ad fratres.</note> 
                     <hi>and for his ſake healed his Father of a Palſie, and cured his Mother of a Leproſie: and next to</hi> Peter, <hi>honoured him above all other his Apoſtles.</hi> Of this we are ſure, that he kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and waſhed his feet, and made him his treaſurer, and his Almoner; and that now <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray Chriſt; O how doth this add to the ſufferings of Chriſt, and to the Sin of <hi>Judas? Behold, a multitude,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> in the front: <hi>he went before them, tam pedibus quam moribus; in his preſence, and in his malice.</hi> The Evangeliſt gives the reaſon of this, that he might have the better opportunity to kiſs him, this was the ſign he gave the rout; <hi>whomſoever I ſhall kiſs, that is he, lay hold on him;</hi> he begins war with a Kiſs, and breaks the peace of his Lord by a Symbole of kindneſs: Jeſus takes this ill; <hi>What,</hi> Judas! <hi>betrayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſs? q. d.</hi> What,<note place="margin">Luke 22.48.</note> doſt thou make the ſeal of Love the ſign of treachery?

The perfidious denial of perjured <hi>Peter.</hi> 6. The ſhameful deluſion, and abuſes of the baſe Attendants.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the captious examination of the High Prieſt: <hi>The High Prieſt then asked Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of his Diſciples,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 18.19.</note> 
                     <hi>and of his Doctrine.</hi> 1. Of his Diſciples; what the Queſtions were, it is not expreſſed; but probably they might be ſuch as theſe; <hi>How many Diſciples he had? and where they were? and what was become of them? why he ſhould take upon him to be better guarded than others of greater place and calling? whether it did not ſavour of ſedition and diſturbance of the State, to lead about ſuch a Crew of Diſciples and followers after him? and what was the reaſon of their flight? whether it were not a token of their guiltineſs of ſome diſorder, or of riotous practiſes?</hi> It is not for me to ſpeak how many Queries the High Prieſt might make to tempt Jeſus; but certainly he was ſifted to the Bran, examined to the full of all ſuch circumſtances as either might trap Chriſt, or in the leaſt degree advance and help forward his Condemnation; to this queſtion concerning his Diſciples, our Saviour anſwered nothing; alas, he knew the frailty of his followers, he might have ſaid, <hi>For my Diſciples, you ſee one hath betrayed me, and another will anon forſwear me, he ſtayes but for the crowing of the Cock, and then you ſhall hear him curſe and ſwear, that he never knew me; and for all the reſt, a pannick fear hath ſeized upon their hearts, and they are fled, and have left me alone to tread the Wine-preſs.</hi> Ah no, he will not ſpeak evil of the Teachers of his people; it was grief to him, and added to his ſufferings,<note place="margin">John 6.67, 68, 69.</note> that all had forſaken him; once before this, <hi>many of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him;</hi> which occaſioned Jeſus to ſay to the twelve, <hi>will ye alſo go?</hi> why no, ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> then, <hi>Lord, whether ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of Eternal Life; and we believe, and are ſure, that thou art that Chriſt the Son of the Living God.</hi> Oh <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> what a ſtrong Faith was that? <hi>We believe, and we are ſure;</hi> but how is it now that ye have no faith? or why are ye ſo fearful, O ye of little Faith? I believe this ſate upon the heart of Chriſt, and yet he would not accuſe them, who now ſtood in their places, and was accuſed for them, and for us all; and therefore to that queſtion of his Diſciples, he anſwered nothing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He asked him of his Doctrine; what his queſtions were of that, are not ſet down neither; but probably they might be ſuch as theſe; <hi>Who was his Maſter, or inſtructer in that new Doctrine he had lately broached? why he did ſeek to innovate, and alter their long practiſed and accuſtomed Rites? and what ground had he to bring in his own devices in their ſteads? as Baptiſm for Circumciſion; the Lords Supper for the Paſſover; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Apoſtles for the high Prieſts and Levites, when neither he, nor moſt of them were of that Tribe? why he was ſo bold and ſaucy (being but three and thirty years of age) to declame ſo bitterly and ſatyrically againſt the Phariſees, and Sadduces, and Scribes, and Prieſts, and Elders of the People?</hi> Much of this ſtuffe he might bring out in his Interrogatories; that ſo by his queſtioning him in many things, he might trap him in ſomething to his confuſion and deſtruction.—And to this queſtion our Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers;<note place="margin">John 18.20, 21.</note> but Oh how wiſely! <hi>I ſpake openly to the World</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whither the Jews alwayes reſorted; and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing; why askeſt thou me? ask them which heard me, what I ſaid unto them, behold they know what I ſaid: q. d.</hi> I appeal to the teſtimony of the very enemies themſelves; thou ſuſpecteſt me to be a ſeditious perſon, and one that plots miſchief againſt the State in ſecret; I tell thee truth, <hi>I ſpeak nothing in ſecret (i.e.)</hi> nothing in the leaſt manner tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſedition; my Doctrine I brought with me from the boſom of my Father, it is the everlaſting Goſpel, and not of yeſterday; and it containes nothing in it of Sedition, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Rebellion, Treaſon; ask theſe mine Enemies, theſe who have apprehended and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:94897:140"/> bound me, and brought me hither; <hi>they know what I ſaid,</hi> let them ſpeak if they can, wherein I have tranſgreſſed the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the ſtroke given Chriſt by that baſe ſervant; <hi>one of the Officers which stood by, ſtroke Jeſus with the palm of his hand, ſaying, anſwereſt thou the High Prieſt ſo?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 18.22.</note> That holy face which was deſigned to be the object of Heaven, in the beholding of which, much of the celeſtial glory doth conſiſt; that face which the Angels ſtare upon with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, like Infants at a bright Sun-beam, was now ſmitten by a baſe varlet in the preſence of a Judge; and howſoever the Aſſembly was full, yet not one amongſt them all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the fact, or ſpake a word for Chriſt: nay, in this the injury was heightned, becauſe the blow was ſaid to be given by <hi>Malchus</hi> an <hi>Idumean</hi> Slave; it was he,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>then led they</hi> Jeſus <hi>from Caiphas unto the Judgment-Hall, and it was early.— When the Morning was come, all the chief Prieſts and Elders of the People took council againſt</hi> Jeſus <hi>to put him to death; and when they had bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.

But on this Circumſtance I ſhall not long ſtay; the tranſactions of this hour I ſhall conſider in theſe two paſſages, Chriſt's Indictment, and <hi>Judas</hi>'s fearful end.</p>
                  <p>In Chriſt's Indictment, we may obſerve, 1. His Accuſation. 2. His Examination.</p>
                  <p>In his Accuſation we may obſerve, 1. Who are his Accuſers. 2. Where he was accuſed. 3. What was the matter of which they do accuſe him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His Accuſers were the <hi>chief Prieſts and Elders of the People;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 27.12.</note> the very ſame that before had judged him <hi>guilty of Death,</hi> are now his Accuſers before the temporal Judge: but why muſt our Saviour be twice Judged? was not the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or Eccleſiaſtical Court ſufficient to condemn him? I anſwer,—He is twice judged; 1. That his Innocency might more appear; true Gold often tried in the fire, is not conſumed, but rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; ſo Chriſt's Integrity, though examined again and again, by divers Judges wholly corrupt; yet thereby it was not hurt, but made rather more illuſtrious. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his firſter judgment was in the night, and a ſentence pronounced then was not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted valid; it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>he judged the People from the morning unto the evening;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 18.13. John 18.31.</note> for until night no judgment was protracted. 3. Becauſe, ſaid the <hi>Jews, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94897:143"/> for us to put any man to death.</hi> Theſe words had need of expoſition; we know <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes's</hi> Law preſcribed death to the Adulterers, Idolaters, Blaſphemers, Man-ſlayers, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breakers: but now the <hi>Romans</hi> (ſay ſome) had come and reſtrained the <hi>Jews</hi> from the execution of their Laws; others are of another mind; and therefore the meaning of theſe words, <hi>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</hi> may be underſtood (ſay they) in a double ſenſe: 1. That it was not Lawful for them to put any man to ſuch a death as the Death of the Croſs: <hi>Moſes's</hi> Law was Ignorant of ſuch a death; and the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſeem to favour this interpretation,<note place="margin">John 18 32.</note> 
                     <hi>that the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfilled, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould die.</hi> We read only of four ſorts of death that were uſed among the <hi>Jews;</hi> as ſtrangling, ſtoning, burning, and killing with the ſword: crucifying was the invention of <hi>Romans,</hi> and not of <hi>Jews.</hi>—2. That it was not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to put any man to death at ſuch a time: on this day was celebrated the <hi>Jews</hi> Paſsover, which was in memory of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo that now they had a cuſtome to deliver ſome from death (the caſe of <hi>Barabbas</hi>) but they could not now condemn any one to death; hence it was, that after <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> had killed <hi>James,</hi> he proceeded further, to take <hi>Peter;</hi> alſo yet during the dayes of unleavened Bread, he delivers him to be kept in Priſon,<note place="margin">Acts. 12.14.</note> 
                     <hi>intending</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>after Eaſter to bring him forth to the People. Pilate,</hi> a Gentile, was not tied to theſe Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they led Jeſus from <hi>Caiaphas unto the Hall of judgment,</hi> or <hi>unto Pilate</hi>'s <hi>Houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The place of the Accuſation was at the door of the Houſe; <hi>they would not go into the Judgment-Hall leſt they ſhould be defiled,</hi>

                     <hi>but that they might eat the Paſsover.</hi> See what a piece of Superſtition and groſe Hypocriſie is here! they are curious of a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but make no ſtrain to ſhed innocent blood; they are preciſe about ſmall matters, but for the weightier matters of the Law, as Mercy, Judgment, Fidelity, and the Love of God, they let them paſs; they honour the figurative Paſsover, but the true Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they ſeize upon with bloody and ſacrilegious hands.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The matter of which they accuſe him. 1. That he ſeduced the People. 2. That he forbade to pay Tribute to <hi>Ceſar.</hi> 3. That he ſaid he was a King. How great? but withal, how falſe were theſe their accuſations? For the firſt, Chriſt was ſo far from ſtirring up Seditions, that he ſtrove and endeavoured to gather the People into one. <hi>O Jeruſalem,</hi>

John 6.15.</note> 
                     <hi>he flieth</hi> from them; and that into the Wilderneſs; or <hi>into a mountain himſelf alone.</hi>—Thus much of the Accuſation,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For his Examination. <hi>Pilate</hi> was nothing moved with any of the Accuſations, ſave only the third: and therefore letting all the reſt paſs, he asked him only, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Pilate</hi> having dismiſſed Jeſus, this hour is concluded with a ſad diſaſter of wicked <hi>Judas; then Judas which betrayed him, when he ſaw that he was condemned,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 27.5.</note> In every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his death, we may take notice of God's Juſtice, and be afraid of ſin; it was juſt that he ſhould hang in the air, who, for his ſin, was hated both of heaven and earth; and that he ſhould fall down headlong, who was fallen from ſuch an height of honour; and that the Halter ſhould ſtrangle that throat, through which the Voice of treaſon had founded; and that his Bowels ſhould be loſt, who had loſt the bowels of all pity, piety, and compaſſion; and that his Ghoſt ſhould have its paſſage out of his midſt (he burſt aſunder in the midſt) and not out of his lips, becauſe with a kiſs of his lips he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his Lord, our bleſſed Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Here's a warning-piece to all the world;<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Luke. 23.8.</note>1. <hi>Herod, queſtioned with him in many words;</hi> what thoſe words were, are not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; only we have ſome conjectures from <hi>Luke</hi> 23.8. <hi>q. d. What! art thou he concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom my Father was ſo mocked of the Wiſe men? and for whoſe ſake my Father ſlew all the Children that were in</hi> Bethlehem? <hi>I have heard thou haſt changed water into Wine, and haſt multiplyed Loaves, whereon ſo many thouſands fed; come, do ſomething at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which elſewhere thou haſt done without requeſt of any; come ſatisfie my deſire, work now but one Miracle before me, that I may be convinc'd of thy Divinity.</hi> I dare not deliver theſe words as certain truths, becauſe of that ſilence that is in Scripture; only we read that <hi>he hoped to have ſeen ſome Miracle done by him. Herod</hi> could not abide to hear his Word, and to bear his yoke: but he was well content to ſee the works and miracles of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatever his queſtions were, <hi>he anſwered him nothing:</hi> many reaſons are given in for this;<note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> as, 1.

Becauſe Chriſt had no need of defence at all: let them go about to Apologize, that are afraid, or guilty of death; as for Chriſt, he deſpiſeth their Accuſations by his very ſilence. 3. Becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> had the year before put <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> to death, who was <hi>that Voice crying in the Wilderneſs;</hi> now that Voice being gone, Chriſt, <hi>the Word,</hi> will be ſilent; he will not give <hi>a Word.</hi> 4. Becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> had been ſottiſhly careleſs of Jeſus Chriſt; he lived in the place where Jeſus more eſpecially had converſed, yet never had ſeen his Perſon, or heard his Sermons. It gives us to learn thus much; that if we neglect the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Grace, and refuſe to hear the voice of Chriſt in the time of Mercy, Chriſt may refuſe to ſpeak one word of comfort to us in our time of need; if we, during our time ſtop our ears, God will, in his time, ſtop his mouth, and ſhut up the ſprings of Grace, that we ſhall receive no refreſhment, no inſtruction, no pardon, no ſalvation. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was reſolved to be Obedient to his Father's Ordinance, he was reſolved to ſubmit to the doom of death with patience and ſilence; for this purpoſe he came into the world, that he might ſuffer in our ſtead, and for our ſins; and therefore he would not plead his own cauſe, nor defend his own innocency in any kind; he knew that we were guilty, though himſelf was not.</p>

                     </gap>; but whether it were white or no, I ſhall not controvert: The Original yields thus far, that it was a <hi>bright and reſplendent garment, ſuch as came newly from the fulling:</hi> many myſteries (if it be white) are found out here; ſome ſay, this held forth the excellency or dignity of Chriſt: White colour is moſt agreeable to the higheſt God; he many times appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in white, but never in any other colour; and the Saints in heaven are ſaid to be <hi>cloathed in long white Robes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 4.4.</note> and Peers, Kings, and <hi>Coeſars</hi> were uſually cloathed in white, ſaith <hi>Janſenius:</hi> Others ſay, this held forth the innocency of Chriſt, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:94897:144"/> that they were directed herein by Divine providence, declaring plainly againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that Chriſt ſhould rather have been abſolved as an innocent, than condemned as a malefactor.—But to leave theſe myſteries, the meaning of <hi>Herod</hi> was not ſo much to declare his excellency, or innocency, as his folly, or ſimplicity; certainly he accounted him for no other than a very fool, and ideot, a paſſing ſimple man. The Philoſophers (ſayes <hi>Tertullian) drew him in their Pictures, attired by</hi> Herod, <hi>like a fool, with long Aſſes ears, his nailes plucked off, and a book in his hand,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg;</hi> and yet that is not all neither, not only is wiſdom in him, but he is <hi>wiſdom</hi> it ſelf (for that is his name and title in the book of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi>) and yet by <hi>Herod</hi> and his Courtiers he is reckoned, arrayed, and derided as a meer ſimple man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They diſmiſt him; in this poſture they ſent him away again to <hi>Pilate,</hi> to all their former deriſion they added this, that now he was expoſed in ſcorn to the boys of the ſtreets. <hi>Herod</hi> would not be content that he and his men of war only ſhould ſet him at naught, but he ſends him away through the more publick, and eminent ſtreets of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> in his white garment, to be ſcorned by the people; to be hooted at by idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; And now was fulfilled the Propheſie of Chriſt, <hi>I was a deriſion to all my people,</hi>

                  <p>Of this let us make ſome uſe. Was the eternal Word of God,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> and the uncreated wiſdom of the Father reputed a fool? no wonder if we ſuffer thouſands of reproaches; <hi>We are made a ſpectakle unto the World, and to Angels, and to men; we are fools for Chriſt's ſake,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.—<hi>We are made as the filth of the world,</hi>

                  <p>ABout nine (which the Jews call the third hour of the day) was Chriſt ſtripped, whipped, cloathed with purple, and crowned with thorns; in this hour his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings came thick.

                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaw how the Jews were ſet upon his death, he conſented, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him firſt to be ſtripped.<note place="margin">Mat. 27.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Then the Souldiers of the Governour took Jeſus into the common Hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of Souldiers, and they ſtripped him.</hi> They pulled of his cloaths, and made hm ſtand naked before them all; He that adorns the Heaven with Stars, and the Earth with Flowers,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.21.</note> and <hi>made coats of skins to cloath our firſt Parents in,</hi> is now himſelf ſtripped ſtark naked; I cannot but look on this as a great ſhame: it appears ſo by our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who no ſooner had ſinned, and knew themſelves naked but they <hi>ſowed fig-leaves together, and made themſelves aprons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.7.</note> If <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo aſhamed of his nakedneſs before his own Wife (who was naked too, as well as he) what a ſhame, and bluſh was it in the face of Chriſt, when in the common Hall in view of the whole band, or company of Souldiers, he ſtands all naked? <hi>My confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is continually before me, and the ſhame of my face hath covered me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 44.15.</note> ſaith <hi>David</hi> in the Perſon of Chriſt. It is reported, in the Eccleſiaſtical ſtory, that when two Martyrs, and holy Virgins (they call them <hi>Agnes,</hi> and <hi>Barbara</hi>) were ſtripped ſtark naked for their execution, God pitying their great ſhame and trouble, to have their nakedneſs diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made for them a veil of light, and ſo he ſent them to a modeſt, and deſired death; but our Saviour Chriſt, who choſe all ſorts of ſhame and confuſion, that by a fulneſs of ſuffering he might expiate his Fathers wrath, and conſecrate to us all kinds of ſufferings and affronts, he endured the ſhame of nakedneſs at the time of his ſcourging; ſee here a naked Chriſt, and therein ſee the mercy of Chriſt to us; he found us like the good <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi> when we were ſtripped, and wounded, and left half dead, and that we might be covered, he quietly ſuffered himſelf to be diveſted of his own robes; he took on him the ſtate of ſinning <hi>Adam,</hi> and became naked, that we might firſt be cloathed with righteouſneſs, and then with immortality; oh what a bleſſed uſe may we make of the very nakedneſs of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Pilate</hi> gave him to be ſcourged; this ſome think he did upon no other account, but that the Jews being ſatiated and glutted with theſe tortures, they might reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and think themſelves ſufficiently avenged, and ſo deſiſt from takeing away his life. That he was ſcourged is without controverſie, for ſo the Evangeliſt relates, <hi>Then Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late took Jeſus and ſcourged him:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 19.1.</note> and that <hi>Pilate</hi> might give him to be ſcourged on that account is very probable, becauſe that after the ſcourging, he brings him out to the Jews, proclaming, <hi>I find no fault in him;</hi> and before his ſcourging,<note place="margin">Ver. 6. Luke 23.15, 16.</note> he ſpeaks it more expreſly, <hi>He hath done nothing worthy of death, I will therefore chaſtiſe him, and releaſe him.</hi> And it adds to this, that howſoever the cuſtome was, that thoſe that were to be crucified muſt firſt be whipped, yet <hi>if they were adjudged to dye, their ſtripes muſt be leſs, and if they were to be ſet at liberty, they muſt be beaten with more ſtripes;</hi>

                     </note> And <hi>Pilate</hi> endeavouring to preſerve his life, they ſcourged him above meaſure, even almoſt to death.</p>
                  <p>In this ſcourging of Chriſt I ſhall inſiſt on theſe two things; 1. The ſhame. 2. The pain.</p>

                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:94897:147"/>1. For the ſhame, it was of ſuch infamy that the <hi>Romans</hi> Exempted all their Citizens from it.<note place="margin">Act. 22.25, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Is it lawful for you</hi> (ſaid Paul) <hi>to ſcourge a man that is a Roman?—And when the Centurion heard that, he went, and told the chief Captain, ſaying, take heed what thou doſt, for this man is a Roman;</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> looked upon it as a moſt infamous puniſhment, fit only for theeves and ſlaves, and not for free-born or priviledged <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> and the Jews themſelves would not ſuffer it above ſo many ſtripes, leſt a brother ſhould ſeem vile unto them;<note place="margin">Deut. 25.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>If a wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the Judge ſhall cauſe him to lye down,—forty ſtripes he may give him, and not exceed, leſt if he ſhould exceed, and beat him above theſe with many ſtripes, then thy brother ſhould ſeem vile unto thee.</hi> Whipping is ſo unworthy a puniſhment, that only children, bondſlaves, and rogues were uſed to be corrected therewith, eſpecially if they exceeded the number of forty ſtripes;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.24.</note> when <hi>Paul</hi> was thus uſed, he tells us, <hi>Of the Jewes five times received I forty ſtripes ſave one.

O then if one ſtripe above forty was ſo infamous amongſt the Jews, what ſhame, what infamy was this, when ſo many ſcores, hundreds, and thouſands of ſtripes (as ſome reckon them) were laid on Jeſus Chriſt? and yet our Lord doth not diſdain to undergo them for our ſakes, he bears in his body thoſe wounds and ſtripes that we had deſerved by our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                     <hi>Bring forth him that hath curſed without the camp, and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him;</hi> now Chriſt had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the band, that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> which they called Blaſphemy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why might they not all (according to this Law) lay their hands upon him, and fall upon him if not with ſtones (which now was turned into whipping) yet with rods, whip-cords, and little chains?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not contend about the number of his ſtripes; but this is certain, that the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with violence and unrelenting hands, executed their commiſſion; they tore his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fleſh, till the pillar and pavement were purpled with a ſhower of blood; and if we may believe <hi>Bernard,</hi> 
                     <q>They plowed with their whips upon his back, and made long furrows, and after that they turned his back upon the pillar, and whipt his belly and his breaſt, till there was no part free from his face unto his foot.</q> A ſcourging able to kill any man, and would have killed him, but that he was preſerved by the Godhead to endure, and to ſuffer a more ſhameful death.</p>

From this ſight of Chriſt, as he was preſented by <hi>Pilate</hi> to the people, we may learn remorſe: not any of us who have crucified Chriſt by our ſins, but we are called on at this time, to <hi>behold the man;</hi> ſuppoſe we ſaw him with our bodily eyes; ſuppoſe we had the ſame view of Chriſt as the Jews had, where he was thus preſented; ſuppoſe we ſaw him in the very midſt of us, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe, and the cane or reed held in his right hand; ſuppoſe we heard the voice of <hi>Pilate</hi> ſpeaking to us, as he did to the <hi>Jews, Behold the man;</hi> ſuppoſe we ſaw the purple robe lifted up, that we might ſee all under, how his body was torn; and that ſame voice from Heaven ſhould come to us,<note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note> ſaying, <hi>This ſame is he whom ye have buffetted, ſcourged, crowned, crucified by your ſins:</hi> were not this enough to prick us in our hearts, and to make us cry, <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> Oh we look at the inſtruments, and we cry, <hi>Fie on Pilate, fie on the Souldiers, fie on the Jews;</hi> but we look not on our ſins, ſaying, <hi>fie on them.</hi> Could we but reallize our ſins as the principal of theſe ſufferings of Chriſt, methinks our hearts ſhould break in very pieces: conſider, yeſterday in the midſt of our Markets ſo many lies were told, and ſo many oaths were ſworn; and this day ſo ſoon as the day-light ſprang, ſo many acts of prophaning the Lords day were committed by us; little did we think that all this while we had been ſtripping Chriſt naked, whipping Chriſt with rods, or little chains, cloathing Chriſt with a Purple-Scarlet Robe, platting a Crown of Thorns, and putting it on his head, ſceptring him with a reed, and ſaluting him in ſcorn, <hi>Hail King of the Jews.</hi> Men, Brethren, and Fathers, be not deceived, Chriſt is mocked, ſcorned, and thus abuſed by you when you ſin; your ſins thus dealt with Chriſt, and in God's acceptation your ſins thus deal with Chriſt even to this very day. Never ſay, it was long ſince Chriſt was crucified, and he is now in Heaven, for by your ſins you crucifie again the Lord of glory, you put him again to open ſhame; you ſtrip him, and whip him, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him afreſh. Oh look on him whom you have pierced! <hi>Pilate</hi> thought that if the Jews would but ſee the man, <hi>Behold the man,</hi> their hearts would have molified, and ſhall not I think as well of you? it is a bleſſed means to make ſin bitter, and to breed in our hearts remorſe for ſin, if we will but hearken to this voice of <hi>Pilate, Behold the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the ſentence of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt ſhould be crucified, as the Jews required,</hi> we may learn the deceitfulneſs of our hearts, in making ſelf the end, and aim of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:94897:149"/> our particular callings. <hi>Pilate</hi> as Judge ſhould have glorified God in doing juſtice; but when he hears the Jews cry, <hi>If thou let him go, thou art not Ceſar</hi>'s <hi>Friend,</hi> he then looks to himſelf, and his own intereſts. Judges can have their ends in the very place of judicature: nay, is not this the very common ſin of Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of all ſorts of callings; come, what is it you aim at in your ſeveral places? is it not to be great, and rich, and high, and honourable? ſay truly, is it in your hearts to ſay, that <hi>by this calling my chief aim is to glorifie God, and to ſerve my generation with all faithfulneſs; and theſe two ends I prefer before all worldly advantages whatſoever?</hi> O then what a bleſſed reformation would be amongſt us? if it be not thus, what are you but as ſo many <hi>Pilate</hi>'s, that if you were but threatned into a ſentence, you would rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Chriſt than your ſelves of enmity againſt <hi>Ceſar;</hi> ſuch would be the cry, <hi>Let Chriſt be crucified, and ſelf advanced.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Much more might be ſaid, but the hour ſtrikes again; <hi>Pilate</hi> is now riſen, the Court diſſolved, and Jeſus is delivered into the hands of the Jews for execution.

                     <hi>which alſo bewailed and lamented him; but Jeſus turning to them, ſaid, Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, and for your Children.</hi> In the midſt of his miſery he forgets not mercy; in the midſt of all their tortures and loudeſt out-cryes of contumely, of blaſphemy, of ſcorn, he can hear his following friends weeping behind him, and neglect all his own ſufferings to comfort them, <hi>Weep not for me.</hi> He hath more compaſſion on the Woman that follow him weeping, than of his own mangled ſelf, that reels along, fainting and bleeding unto death: he feels more the tears that drop from their eyes, than all the blood that flows from his own veins: we heard before that ſometimes he would not vouchſafe a word to <hi>Pilate</hi> that threatened him, nor to <hi>Herod</hi> that entreated him, and yet unaskt how graciouſly doth he <hi>turn about</hi> his bleſſed bleeding face to theſe weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing women, affording them looks, and words too, both of compaſſion and of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>weep not for me, but for your ſelves.</hi>—and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, he did not turn his face to them until he heard them weep; nor may we ever think to ſee his face in glory, unleſs we firſt bathe our eyes in ſorrow. It is a wonder to me that any in our age ſhould ever decry tears, remorſe, contrition, compunction; how many Saints do we find both in the Old and New Teſtament, confuting by their practiſes theſe groſs opinions? the Promiſe tells us, that <hi>They that ſow in Tears ſhall reap in Joy;</hi> he that follows Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 126.5, 6.</note> or <hi>goeth forth weeping, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing, bringing his ſheaves with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what's the meaning of this, <hi>Weep not for me?</hi> may we not weep for the death of Chriſt?<note place="margin">Deut. 34.8. Acts 8.2.</note> do we not find in Scripture that all the People wept at the death of <hi>Moſes?</hi> that all the Church wept at the death of <hi>Stephen?</hi> that the Woman lamented the death of <hi>Dorcas?</hi> and if all Chriſt's actions be our inſtructions (I mean not his miraculous, or meritorious, but his moral ones) did not Chriſt himſelf weep for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> nay, is he not here weeping ſhowers of blood all along the way? and may not we drop a tear for all thoſe purple ſtreams of his?

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the words are not abſolute, but comparative. Chriſt doth not ſimply forbid us to weep for our friends, but rather to turn our worldly grief into godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin as ſin. Chriſt herein pointed the women to the true cauſe and ſubject of all their ſorrow, which was their ſins; and thus we have cauſe to weep indeed. Oh! our ſins were the cauſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and in that reſpect, Oh that our heads were fountains, and our eyes rivers of tears! Oh that our tears were as our meat and drink! Oh that we could feed with <hi>David on the Bread of tears,</hi> and that the Lord would give us <hi>plenteouſneſs of tears to drink!</hi> Oh that the Lord would ſtrike (as he did at <hi>Rephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim</hi>) theſe rocky hearts of ours, with the rod of true remorſe, that water might guſh out!

                  <p>But the hour goes on, and this is the great buſineſs of the worlds redemption, of which I would ſpeak a little more; by this time we may imagine Chriſt nailed to the croſs, and his croſs fixed in the ground, which with its fall into the place of its ſtation gave infinite torture by ſo violent a concuſſion of the body of our Lord. That I mean to obſerve of this crucifying of Chriſt, I ſhall reduce to theſe two heads. <hi>viz.</hi> the ſhame and pain.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the ſhame, it was a curſed death, <hi>curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> When it was in uſe, it was chiefly infflicted upon ſlaves that either falſely accuſed, or treacherouſly conſpired their Maſters death: but on whomſoever it was inflicted, this death in all Ages among the <hi>Jews</hi> hath been branded with a ſpecial kind of ignominy; and ſo the Apoſtle ſignifies when he ſaith, <hi>He abaſed himſelf to the death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.8. 2 Sam. 21.6. Deut. 21.23.</note> 
                     <hi>even to the death of the croſs.</hi> It was a mighty ſhame that <hi>Saul's</hi> ſons were hanged on a tree, and the reaſon was more ſpecially from the Law of God; <hi>For he that is hanged is accurſed of God:</hi> I know <hi>Moſes's</hi> Law ſpeakes nothing in particular of crucifying, yet he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ſame under the general of hanging on a tree; and ſome conceive that <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſpeaking that curſe, foreſaw what manner of death the Redeemer ſhould dye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the pain, it was a painfull death; that appears ſeveral wayes; As— 1. His legs and hands were violently racked, and pulled out to the places fitted for his faſtening, and then pierced through with nails. 2. By this means he wanted the uſe both of his hands and feet, and ſo he was forced to hang immovable upon the croſs, as being unable to turn any way for his caſe. 3. The longer he lived, the more he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for by the weight of his body his wounds were opened and enlarged, his nerves and veins were rent and torn aſunder, and his blood guſhed out more and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſtill. 4. He died by inch-meal (as I may ſay) and not at once, the croſs was a death long in dying, it kept him a great while upon the rack, it was full three hours betwixt Chriſt's affixion and expiration, and it would have been longer if he had not freely and willingly given up the Ghoſt; it is reported that <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle was two whole dayes on the Croſs before he dyed, and ſo long might Chriſt have been, if God had not heightened it to greater degrees of torment ſupernaturally.</p>
                  <p>I may add to this, as above all this, the pains of his ſoul whiles he hanged on the croſs, for there alſo Chriſt had his agonies, and ſoul conflicts, theſe were thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The cauſe of this darkneſs is diverſly rendered by ſeveral Authors; ſome think that <hi>the Sun by Divine power with-drew, and held back its beams.</hi> Others ſay,<note place="margin">Hier. <hi>in Mat. 17.</hi> Orig. tract. <hi>35.</hi> in Matth.

                  <p n="2">2. About three (which the Jews call the nineth hour) the Sun now beginning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his light, <hi>Jeſus cryed with a loud voice, Eli, Eli, Lamaſabachthani, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?—And then, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. About four in the afternoon he was pierced with a ſpear, and there iſſued out of his ſide both blood and water. And <hi>one of the Souldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</hi> How truly may we ſay of the Souldiers,<note place="margin">John 19.34.</note> that <hi>after all his ſufferings they have added wounds?</hi> they find him dead, and yet they will ſcarce believe it, until with a ſpear they have ſearch'd for life at the well-head it ſelf, even at the heart of Chriſt: And <hi>forthwith there came out blood and water;</hi> this was the Fountain of both Sacraments, the Fountain of all our happineſs,<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> 
                     <hi>The Fountain opened to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem for ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi> There are three that bear-witneſs on earth (ſaith <hi>John) the Spirit, and the Water,</hi>

                     <hi>and the Blood.</hi> Out of the ſide of Chriſt being now dead; there iſſues <hi>water and blood;</hi> ſignifying that he is both our juſtification, and ſanctification. Phyſitians tell us, that about the heart there is a film or skin like unto a purſe, wherein is contained clear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool the heat of the heart, and therefore very probable it is, that, that very skin (or <hi>pericardium</hi>) was pierced through with the heart, and thence came out thoſe ſtreams of blood and water.—<hi>O gates of Heaven! O windows of Paradiſe! O Palace of refuge! O Tower of ſtrength! O Sanctuary of the Juſt! O flouriſhing bed of the Spouſe of Solomon! methinks I ſee water and blood running out of his ſide more freſhly, than thoſe golden ſtreams which ran out of the garden of Eden, and watered the whole world.</hi> Here if I could ſtay I might lengthen my Doctrine during my life; oh it were good to be here; it were a large field, and a bleſſed ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. About five (which the Jews call the eleventh, and the laſt hour of the day) Chriſt was taken down, and buried by <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> But enough, I muſt not wear out your patience altogether.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. LEt us <hi>know Jeſus,</hi> carrying on the great work of our Salvation during his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and death. This is the high point which <hi>Paul</hi> was ever ſtudying on, and preaching on, and pondering on; <hi>For I determined not to know any thing among you,</hi>

                     <hi>ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> Chriſt crucified is the rareſt piece of knowledge in the world; the perſon of Chriſt is a matter of high ſpeculation, but Chriſt further conſidered, as cloathed with his garments of blood, is that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which eſpecially <hi>Paul</hi> purſues; he eſteems not, reckons not, determines not to make any profeſſion of any other ſcience or doctrine than the moſt neceſſary, and only ſaving knowledge of Chriſt crucified. O my ſoul, how many dayes, and months, and years, haſt thou ſpent to attain ſome little meaſure of knowledge in the Arts, and Tongues, and Sciences? and yet what a poor skill haſt thou attained in reſpect of the many thouſands of them that knew nothing at all of Jeſus Chriſt? and what if thou hadſt reached out to a greater proficiency? couldſt thou have dived into the ſecrets of Nature, couldſt thou have excelled <hi>the wiſdom of all the children of the Eaſt country, and all the wiſdom of Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 4.33.</note> 
                     <hi>and the wiſdom of Solomon, who ſpake of beaſts, of fowls, of fiſhes, of all trees from the Cedar tree that is in Lebanon, even to the hyſſop that ſpringeth out of the wall,</hi> yet without the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt crucified (Chriſt ſuffering, bleeding, and dying) all this had been nothing, ſee <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.18. only that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is worth the having which refers to Chriſt; and above all that is the rareſt piece of Chriſt's humiliation, which holds him forth ſuffering for us, and ſo freeing us from hell ſufferings. Come then, and ſpend thy time for the future more fruitfully in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, learning, knowing, this <hi>one neceſſary thing.</hi> Study Chriſt crucified in every piece and part; O the precious truths, and precious diſcoveries that a ſtudying head and heart would hammer out here! much hath been ſaid, but a thouſand-thouſand times more might yet be ſaid; we have given but a little ſcantling of that which Chriſt endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Volumes might be written till they were piled as high as heaven; and yet all would not ſerve to make out the full diſcoveries of Jeſus's ſufferings. Study therefore, and ſtudy more, but be ſure thy ſtudy and thy knowledge be rather practical than ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; do not meerly beat thy brains to learn the hiſtory of Chriſt's death, but the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, vertue, and merit of it; know what thou knoweſt in reference to thy ſelf, as if Jeſus had been all the while carrying on the buſineſs of thy ſouls ſalvation; as if thou hadſt ſtood by, and Chriſt had ſpoke to thee, as ſometimes to the women, <hi>Weep not for me, but for thy ſelf; thy ſins cauſed my ſufferings, and my ſufferings were for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of thy ſins.</hi>

As in this manner.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider him paſſing over the Brook <hi>Cedron;</hi> it ſignifies the wrath of God, and rage of men; the firſt ſtep of his paſſion is ſharp and ſore; he cannot enter the door, but firſt he muſt wade through cold waters on bare feet, nor muſt he only wade through them, but <hi>drink</hi> of them; through many tribulations muſt he go that will purchaſe ſouls, and through many tribulations muſt they go that will follow after him to the Kingdom of Glory.—Conſider him entring into the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane;</hi> in a garden <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and in this garden Chriſt muſt ſuffer, that the ſame place which was the neſt where ſin was hatched, might now be the child-bed of grace and mercy; into this garden no ſooner was he entred, but he began to be agonized; all his powers and paſſions within him were in conflict. Conſider O my ſoul how ſuddenly he is ſtruck into a ſtrange <hi>fear;</hi> never was man ſo afraid of the torments of hell, as Chriſt (ſtanding in our room) is of his Fathers wrath; fear is ſtill ſuitable to apprehenſion, and never man could ſo perfectly apprehend the cauſe of fear as Jeſus Chriſt; nor was he only afraid, but very heavy; <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death.</hi> His ſorrow was lethal and deadly, it melted his ſoul gradually as wax is melted with heat; it continued with him till his laſt gaſp, his heart was like wax burning all the time of his paſſion, and at laſt <hi>it melted in the midſt of his bowels.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 22.19. Mark 14.33.</note> Nor was he only afraid and heavy, but he began to be ſore amazed; this ſignifies an univerſal ceſſation of all the faculties of the ſoul from their ſeveral functions, we uſually call it a conſternation, it is like a Clock ſtopped for the while from going, by ſome hand or other laid upon it; or if it was not wholly a ceſſation, yet was it at leaſt an expavefaction, ſuch a motion of the mind as whereby for the preſent he was diſinabled to mind any thing elſe, but the dreadful ſenſe of the wrath of God. O what an <hi>agony</hi> was this? O what a ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling paſſion of mixed grief was this? what afflicting and conflicting affections under the ſight and ſenſe of eminent peril was in this <hi>agony?</hi>

                     <hi>And being in an agony he prayed more earneſtly;</hi> thrice had he prayed, but now in his agony he prayed more earneſtly; <hi>O my Father if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Though I feel the ſoul of pain in the pain of my ſoul, yet there is divinity in me, which tells me there is a wage for ſin, and I will pay it all? O my Father ſith thou haſt bent thy bow, lo here an open breaſt, fix herein all thy ſhafts of fury, better I ſuffer for a while than that all believers ſhould be damned for ever; thy will is mine, lo I will bear the burthen of ſin, come and ſhoot here thy arrows of revenge. And thus as he prayed he ſweat,<note place="margin">Luke 22.44.</note> 
                     <hi>And is ſweat was as it were great drops of blood fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to the ground.</hi> Oh what man or Angel can conceive the agony, the fear, the ſorrow, the amazement of that heart, that without all outward violence, meerly out of the extremity of his own paſſion, bled through the fleſh and skin, not ſome faint dew, but ſolid drops of blood? now is he crucified without a croſs, fear and ſorrow are the nails, our ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Conſider his apprehenſion; <hi>Judas</hi> is now at hand, with a troop following him to apprehend his Maſter, ſee how without all ſhame he ſet himſelf in the van, and coming to his Lord and Maſter, gives him a moſt Traiterous and deceitful kiſs, <hi>What Judas, betrayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſs?</hi> haſt thou ſold the Lord of life to ſuch cruel merchants as covet greedily his blood and life? O alas! at what price haſt thou ſet the Lord of all the creatures? at thirty pence? what a vile and ſlender price is this for a Lord of ſuch Glory and Majeſty? God was ſold for thirty pieces of ſilver, but man could not be bought without the deareſt heart-blood of the Son of God.<note place="margin">Luke 22.53.</note> At that time ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Ye be come as it were againſt a thief with ſwords and ſtaves,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:94897:153"/> I ſate daily among you teaching in the Temple, and ye never laid hands on me, but this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs.</hi> Now the Prince of darkneſs exerciſed his power, now the helliſh rout, and malicious rabble of ravenous wolves, aſſaulted the moſt innocent Lamb in the world; now they moſt furiouſly haled him this way and that way; O how ungently did they handle him? how uncourteouſly ſpake they unto him? how many blows and buffets did they give him? what cries, and ſhouts, and clamours made they over him: now they lay hold on his holy hands, and bind them hard with rough and knotty cords, ſo that they gall the skin off his arms, and make the very blood ſpring out; now they bring him back again over <hi>Cedron,</hi> and they make him once again to <hi>drink of the brook in the way;</hi> now they lead him openly through the high ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and carry him to the houſe of <hi>Annas</hi> in great triumph. O my ſoul conſider theſe ſeveral paſſages, conſider them leiſurely, and with good attention, conſider them till thou feeleſt ſome motions or alterations in thy affection; is not this he that is the infinite vertue, the pattern of innocency, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wiſdom; the honour of earth, the glory of heaven, the very fountain of all beauty) whether of men or Angels! how is it then that this vertue or power is tyed with bands, that innocency is apprehended, that wiſdom is flouted and laughed to ſcorn, that honour is contemned, that glory is tormented, that he that is fairer than all the children of men, is beſmeared with weeping, and troubled with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart? ſurely there is ſome thing O my ſoul in thee, that cauſed all this: hadſt not thou ſinned, the Sun of Righteouſneſs had never been ecliſped.</p>

O my ſoul, why doſt thou not humble thy ſelf, at this ſo wonderful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? how is it that there ſhould remain in the world any token of pride after this ſo great and marvellous an example of humility? ſurely I am at my wits end, and very much aſtoniſhed to conſider, how this ſo great patience overcomes not my anger, how this ſo great abaſing aſſwageth not my pride, how theſe ſo violent buffets beat not down my preſumption: Is it not marvellous that Jeſus Chriſt by theſe means ſhould overthrow the Kingdom of pride, and yet that there ſhould remain in me the relicks of pride? conſider all thoſe night-ſufferings of Chriſt; O cruel night! O unquiet night! now was the ſeaſon that all creatures ſhould take their reſt, that the ſenſes, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers wearied with toils and labours, ſhould be refreſhed; but on the contrary Chriſt's members and ſenſes were then tormented, they ſtruck his body, they afflicted his ſoul, they bound his hands, they buffetted his cheeks, they ſpit in his face; O my ſoul thou ſinneſt in the dark, in covert, in ſecret, when no eye is upon thee, when the Sun, that eye of the world is ſet, or hid; and therefore all the night long is Chriſt thus tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by thy ſins; not one jot of reſt hath Chriſt, not a wink of ſleep muſt ſeize on him, whom thou by the alarm of thy ſins diſquieted, both at evening, at mid-night, and at the Cock-Crow, and at the dawning.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider the hurryings of Jeſus from <hi>Caiphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate;</hi> now he ſtands before <hi>Pilate,</hi> where he was accuſed of ſedition, ſeduction, and uſurpation. Not only Jews, but <hi>Gentiles</hi> have their hands imbrewed in the blood of Chriſt; <hi>Pilate</hi> was delegated from <hi>Ceſar,</hi>

Here's a King without either preſence-chamber, or bed-chamber, <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man hath not whereon to lay his head.</hi> Come, fear not <hi>Pilate</hi> the loſs of thy diadem; it may be the people would ſometimes have made him a King, but ſee how he flies from it, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> ſaith Jeſus.

Oh my ſoul, I feel it, I feel it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I can be free from the affection of all creatures, I cannot with freedom of mind aſpire unto divine things; unleſs I be willing with Chriſt to tread on Crowns and Scepters, to be deſpiſed and forſaken of all, and to be eſteemed nothing at all, I can have no inward peace, nor be ſpiritually enlightned, nor be wholly united to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

And now hear the voice that comes from the Son of God, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Chriſt in the Garden taſted the bitter cup of God's fierce wrath, but now he drunk the dregs of it; he then ſipped off the top, but now he drunk all off, top, and bottom, and all.

This was not a total, but a partial dereliction, this was not a perpetual, but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary forſaking of him; the Godhead was not took away from the manhood, but the union remained ſtill, even now when the Manhood was forſaken. 2. This was not a forſaking on Chriſt's part, but only on the Father's part; the Father forſook Chriſt, but Chriſt went after him; God took away the ſenſe of his love, but the Son of God laid hold upon him, crying, and ſaying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> 3. This forſaking was not in reſpect of his being, but in reſpect of the feeling of God's favour, love, and mercy; certainly God loved him ſtill, Oh but his ſenſe of comfort was now quite gone, ſo as it never was before: In his agony there was ſome inklings of God's mercy, now and then at leaſt there was ſome ſtar-light, ſome little flaſh of lightning to cheer him up, but now all the ſenſe and feeling of God's love was gone, and not ſo much as any little ſtar-light of the ſame appeared. Chriſt now took the place of ſinners, and God the Father ſhut him out (as it were) amongſt the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he drew his mercy out of ſight, and out of hearing, and therefore he cryed out in a kind of wonderment, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> After this he ſpeaks but a few words more, and he gives up the Ghoſt. He dyes that we might live, he is diſſolved in himſelf, that we might be united to his Father; O my ſoul, ſee him now if thou canſt for weeping, his eyes are dim, his cheeks are wan, his face is pale, his head is bowing, his heart is panting, himſelf is dying; come, come, and dye with him by a moſt exact mortification; look pale like him with grief, and ſorrow, and trouble for thy ſins.</p>

                  <p>But what is there in Chriſt's blood or death that is ſo deſirable? I anſwer,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is in it the perſon of Chriſt, he that is God-man, man-God,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>The bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his father's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> it is he that dyed; every drop of his blood was not only the blood of an innocent man, but of one that was God as well as man, <hi>God with his own blood purchaſed the Church;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> now ſurely every thing of God is moſt deſirable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is in it a worth, or price; Chriſt conſidered under the notion of a ſacrifice is of infinite worth; now <hi>this ſacrifice</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he offered up,</hi> Heb. 9.28.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.28.</note> He offered up, not in Heaven, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it, in preſenting himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God his Father, but upon earth, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Paſſion upon the Croſs. No wealth in heaven or earth beſides this, could redeem one ſoul, and therefore the Apoſtle ſets this againſt all <hi>corruptible things, as ſilver and gold,</hi> the things ſo much ſet by amongſt the men of this world; <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is in it a merit and ſatisfaction; the Scripture indeed doth not expreſly uſe theſe words, but it hath the ſenſe and meaning of them; As in that text,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.7.</note>

A great controverſie is of late riſen up, <hi>Whether Chriſt's death be a ſatisfaction to Divine juſtice?</hi> But the very words <hi>redeeming and buying,</hi> do plainly demonſtrate; that a ſatisfaction was given to God by the death of Jeſus;<note place="margin">Tit. 2 14. 1 Cor. 6.20.

                  <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us that Chriſt's ſufferings and death were not for ſatisfaction to God, but in reference to us, that we might believe the truth of his Doctrine confirmed and ſealed (as they ſay) by his death, and that we might yield obedience to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern that he hath ſet before us, and that ſo believing and obeying, we might obtain the remiſſion of Sins and eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>But the Scripture goes higher; in that mutual compact and agreement betwixt God and Chriſt, we find God the Father impoſing, and Chriſt ſubmitting to this ſatisfaction.<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.6.</note> 1. The Father impoſeth it by charging the ſins of his Elect upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> not the ſins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not the evill in them, or fault of them, but the guilt and penalty belonging to them; this God laid upon his Son, and charged it upon him; he charged it as a Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor chargeth the debt upon the Surety, requiring ſatisfaction. 2. Chriſt undertook it. <hi>He was oppreſſed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>and he was afflicted,</hi> or as ſome tranſlate, <hi>It was exacted, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; (i.e.)</hi> God the Father required ſatisfaction for ſin, and Jeſus Chriſt was our Surety anſwered in our behalf;<note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>He bear the Sins of many,</hi> he bear them as a porter that bears the burthen for another which himſelf is not able to ſtand under; he bear them by undergoing the puniſhment which was due for them, he bear them as our Surety, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf unto the penalty which we had deſerved; and by that means he made ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God. Surely Chriſts death was not only for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Doctrine, but for ſatisfaction to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is in it not only a true, but a copious, and full ſatisfaction; Chriſt's death and blood is ſuperabundant to our ſins; <hi>The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant</hi> 1. Tim. 1.14. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> it was over-full, redundant, more than enough. Many an humble ſoul is apt enough to complain, <hi>Oh if I had not been ſo great a ſinner, if I had not committed ſuch and ſuch tranſgreſſions, there might have been hope;</hi> This is to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue Chriſt's redemption, this is to think there is more in ſin to damn, than in Chriſt's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to ſave; whereas all thy Sins to Chriſt are but as a little cloud to the glorious Sun; yea, all the Sins of all the men in the world, are but to Chriſts merits as a drop to the Ocean. I ſpeak not this to encourage the preſumptuous ſinner; for alaſs, he hath no part in this ſatisfaction; but to comfort the humble ſinner, who is loaden with the ſenſe of his Sins; what though they were a burthen greater than he can bear? yet they are not a burthen greater than Chriſt can bear; there is in Chriſt's blood an infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, able to ſanctifie thee, and all the World, there is in Chriſts death a ranſome, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprice ſufficient to redeem all the ſinners, that ever were, or ever ſhall be; the price is of that nature, that it is not diminiſhed, though it be extended to never ſo many; as the Sun hath fulneſs of light to enlighten all the world; and if the blind do not ſee by it, it is no any ſcarcity of light in the Sun, but by reaſon of his own indiſpoſition; ſo if all men are not acquitted by Chriſt's death, it's not becauſe that was inſufficient, as if it had not vertue enough to reach them as well as others, but becauſe they by their unbelief do reject this remedy. Oh what large room hath ſaith to expatiate in! ſit down, and dive, and dive, yet thou canſt not come to the bottom of Chriſt's blood; but as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw ſtill <hi>more and greater abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſo mayeſt thou in the ſufferings of Chriſt obſerve more and more fulneſs.

                  <p n="1">1. If Chriſt's death be mine, then is Chriſt's life mine; and converſe, if Chriſt's death be mine, then is Chriſt's life mine. Chriſt's active and paſſive obedience cannot be ſevered; Chriſt is not divided: we muſt not ſeek one part of our righteouſneſs in his birth, another in his habitual holineſs, another in the integrity of his life, another in his obedience of death. They that endeavour to ſeparate Chriſt's active and paſſive obedience, they do exceedingly derogate from Chriſt, and make him but half a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;<note place="margin">Heb. 7.22.</note> was not Chriſt our <hi>Surety?</hi> Heb. 7.22. and thereupon was he not bound to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil all righteouſneſs for us? <hi>(i.e.)</hi> as to ſuffer in our ſtead, ſo to obey in our ſtead? oh take heed of oppoſing or ſeparating Chriſt's death, and Chriſt's life; either we have all Chriſt, or we have no part in Chriſt; now if theſe two be concomitants, well may the one be as the ſign of the other; ſearch then, and try, O my ſoul, haſt thou
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:94897:156"/> any ſhare in Chriſt's life? canſt thou make out Chriſt's active obedience unto thy own ſoul? if herein thou art at a ſtand, peruſe thoſe Characters laid down in the life of Chriſt; the many glorious effects flowing out of Chriſt's life into a Believer's ſoul we have diſcovered before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Chriſt's death be mine, then is that great end of his death accompliſhed in me, <hi>viz. By the ſacrifice of himſelf he hath put away ſin,</hi> even my ſin.—and,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.26. Eph. 1.7. Dan. 9.24.</note>

Indeed this very Character may ſeem obſcure, aſſurance of pardon is the <hi>hidden Manna, the white Stone which no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſaving he which receives it and feels it;</hi> and yet if thou diligently obſerveſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's actings, even this may be known; remiſſion of ſin and repentance for ſin are twins of a birth; thoſe two God in Scripture hath joined together: <hi>If we confeſs our ſins,</hi>

                     <hi>and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin,</hi> Selah. It is no more, than to ask thy Soul, what, are thy repentings kindled together? haſt thou ſeriouſly and ſincerely repented thee of ſin as ſin? haſt thou turned from all ſin unto God with conſtancy and delight? Surely this is peculiar and proper to the Child of God by vertue of Chriſt's Death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Chriſt's death be mine, then am I engraffed into the likeneſs of Chriſt's death; then am I made conformable to Chriſt in his death, <hi>that I may know him and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable unto his death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.10.</note> The ſame that was done to Chriſt in a natural way, is done and performed in the Believer in a ſpiritual way; <hi>(i.e.)</hi> as Chriſt died, ſo the Believer dies; as Chriſt died for ſin, ſo the Believer dies to ſin; <hi>In that he died, he died unto ſin,—likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto ſin.</hi> Obſerve here the Analogy, and proportion,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.10, 11.</note> and reſemblance betwixt Chriſt and us: both die unto ſin, Chriſt by way of expiation, ſuffering, and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſins of others; we by way of mortification, killing, and ſlaying, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying our own ſins. I look upon this ſign as the very touchſtone of a Chriſtian, and therefore I ſhall inſiſt upon it.</p>
                  <p>Two queſtions I ſuppoſe needful, to reſolve the grounds of our <hi>Hope</hi> concerning our intereſt in the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Whether indeed and in truth our ſins are mortified?</item>
                     <item>2. Whether we encreaſe or grow in our mortification?</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt; whether indeed and in truth our ſins are mortified? It is a skill worth our learning, becauſe of the many deceits that are within us; ſin may ſeem to be mortified when the occaſion is removed; or ſin may ſeem to be mortified, when it is not violent, but quiet; or ſin may ſeem to be mortified, when it is but removed from one ſin unto another; or ſin may ſeem to be mortified, when the ſap and ſtrength of ſin is dead; as the Lamp goes out, when either the Oil is not ſupplied, or taken away. Now that in this ſcrutiny we may ſearch to the bottoom, and know the truth and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our mortification, it will appear by theſe Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True mortification ſprings from a root of Faith. Every thing in the world pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſome cauſe or other; and if the cauſe be good, the effect muſt needs be good; but if the cauſe be evil, the effect muſt needs be evil: <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, and an evil Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 7.18.</note> In this caſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us examine the cauſe; if we can make out this truth, that we belive in Chriſt, that we roll our ſelves on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for life and for ſalvation, and that now we begin to feel in us the decay of ſin, we may conclude from the cauſe or riſe, that this decay of ſin is true mortification; ſurely it hath received the deadly wound: it is a bleſſed effect ariſing from a good, and right, and genuine cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:94897:157"/>2. True mortification is general; not only one ſin, but all ſins are mortified in a true Believer. As death is unto the Members of the body, ſo is mortification unto the members of ſin; now death ſeized upon every member, it leaves not life in any one member of the body; ſo neither doth mortification leave life in any one member of ſin; my meaning is, it takes away the commanding power of ſin in every member: <hi>Mortifie your members which are upon the earth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) your <hi>members,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note> not <hi>one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> and then he inſtanceth, <hi>Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Inordinate Affections, Evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry.</hi> Chriſtians that have their intereſt in Chriſt's death, muſt not only leave Pride, but Luſt; not only Uncleanneſs, but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; Sin muſt not only be ſlain in the underſtanding, but in the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: mortification is general.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay this is an hard ſaying; doth any man, any Believer, leave all ſin? yes, in reſpect of ruling power he leaves all ſin; all groſs ſins, and all other ſins: only with this difference, all groſs ſins in practiſe and actions, and all frailties and infirmities in allowance and affection. It is good to obſerve the degrees of mortification: the firſt is to forbear the practiſe of groſs and ſcandalous ſins in word and deed:<note place="margin">Jam. 3.2.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man;</hi> and this perfection by the help of Grace, a godly man may reach to in this life. The ſecond is to deny conſent and will to all frailties and infirmities:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.19.</note> 
                     <hi>The evil which I would not, that do I,</hi> Rom. 7.19. I may do evil, and yet I <hi>would not do evil;</hi> there is a denial of it in the will. The third is to be free from any ſetled liking of any evil motion: not only to deny conſent and will, but alſo to deny the very thought or imagination ſetledly and deliberately to delight in ſin. I know, to be void of all evil motions ariſing from the fleſh, or of all ſudden paſſions within, or of all ſuduen delights in ſin, or of all deadneſs or backwardneſs to good things by reaſon of ſin, it is an higher pitch than any man can touch in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world: for whilſt we live, the Law of the members will be working, and we ſhall find cauſe enough to complain of a body of death; only, if when theſe motions firſt ariſe, we preſently endeavour to quench them, to reject them, to deteſt them, and to caſt them away from us, therein is true mortification: and thus far we muſt look to it, to leave all ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. True mortification is not without its preſent combats, though at laſt it conquer; many a time corruption may break out, and luſt may be ſtrong and violent; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s violent luſt is only for the preſent, whereas a luſt unmortified ever reigneth. It is with ſin in a Believer, as it is with a man that hath received his deadly wound from his enemy; he will not preſently flie away, but rather he will run more violently upon him that hath wounded him; yet, be he never ſo violent, in the middle of his action he ſinks down, becauſe he hath received his deadly wound; ſo it is with a Believer's ſin, and with a mortified luſt; it may rage in the heart, and ſeem to bear ſway for a time; but the power and ſtrength of ſin is mortified, it ſinks down, and wants ability to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; by this ſign may we know whether the corruptions and ſtirrings of our hearts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a mortified, or from an unmortified luſt; a luſt, though mortified, may rage for a time, but it cannot rule; it may ſtrive, but it cannot totally prevail; it may be in the heart, as a thief in the houſe, not to reſide or dwell, but to lodge for a night, and be gone: And (that which is ever to be obſerved) after its ſwinge and breaking out, the heart that lodged it, abhors its ſelf in duſt and aſhes, cries mightily unto God for mercy and pardon, repairs the breach with ſtronger reſolution, and more invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble watchfulneſs againſt future aſſaults; but a Luſt unmortified poſſeſſeth it ſelf, and rules and reigns in the heart and ſoul; it abides there, and will not away: I ſhall not deny, but there may be a ceſſation of its actings for a time; but that is not any want of good will, as they ſay, but only of matter, means, opportunity, enticement, company, provocation, or the like; and after ſuch ceſſation or forbearance, the heart uſually entertains it again with more greedineſs; it lies and delights in it as much as ever, it hardens it ſelf moſt obſtinately in it, as if it were impoſſible to leave it, or live without it with any kind of comfort.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. True mortification is a painful work. The very word imports no leſs; to kill a man, or to mortifie a member, will not be without pain; hence it is called a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the fleſh,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.24. Mat. 5.29, 30.</note> and a cutting off the right hand, a plucking out the right eye: <hi>they that are Chriſt's have crucified the fleſh; if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; and if thy eye offend thee, pluck it out:</hi> in this reſpect this death unto ſin carries with it a likeneſs to the death
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:94897:157"/> of Chriſt; it is attended with agonies, and ſoul-conflicts, both before, and after our converſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before converſion, before the firſt wound be given it, why then ordinarily there is ſome compunction of Spirit, ſome pricking of heart; what a caſe do we find the <hi>Jews</hi> in, when after <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, they were pricked at their hearts? and what an agony do we find the Jailor in, when he came trembling in, and falling down at the Apoſtles feet, and crying out, <hi>Sirs, What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> With ſuch agonies as theſe,<note place="margin">Acts 2.7. Acts 16.30.</note> is the beginning of mortification uſually attended; I do not ſay that they are alike in all, whether for degree or continuance; but in ordinary, true and ſound converſion is not without ſome of theſe ſoul-conflicts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After converſion, after the firſt round there are ſome agonies ſtill; for though a Believer be delivered of ſin in reſpect of the guilt, and reigning power; yet he hath ſtill ſome remainders of ſinful Corruption left within him, which draw many a groan, and many a ſign from his trembling heart;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note> 
                     <hi>we alſo have the firſt-fruits of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our bodies:</hi> ſuch are the groans of mortifying Saints, Saints dying unto ſin like the groans of dying men, whoſe ſouls being weary of their bodies, do earneſtly deſire a diſſolution: and thus <hi>Paul</hi> groaned, when he ſaid, <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> 
                     <hi>who ſhall deliver me from the body this death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh what a Touchſtone is this? how will ihis diſcover true mortification from that which was counterfeit? Some may think they are dead unto ſin, when in deed and in truth they are not dead, but aſleep unto ſin; and it appears by this, becauſe there were no pangs in their death, you know this is a difference betwixt death and ſleep; there are pangs in the one, but not in the other: O my ſoul, examine, what pangs were there in thy death unto ſin? what agonies, what ſoul-conflicts haſt thou felt? what compunction of heart, what affliction of Spirit, haſt thou endured for ſin? what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble haſt thou had to find <hi>ſuch a law in thy members rebelling againſt the law in thy mind,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> 
                     <hi>and bringing thee into captivity to the Law of ſin?</hi> why ſurely thou art not ſo mortified, as to be freed wholly from the power of ſin; it may be, it doth not rule in thee as a Prince, yet certainly it tyrannizeth over thee, it oft-times carries thee contrary to the bent of thy regenerate mind, to the omittting of what thou wouldſt do, and to the committing of what thou wouldſt not do; and is not this an affliction of Spirit? doth not this cauſe frequent conflicts in thy ſpirit? if not, thou mayeſt well ſuſpect that ſin is not dead, but aſleep; or if it be dead to thee, yet thou art not dead to it, I confeſs, death-pangs are not all alike in all; ſome have a more gentle, and others a more painful death; ſo it is in this Spiritual death unto ſin; and that herein there may be no miſtake, I ſhall propound this queſtion: What is the leaſt meaſure of theſe pangs, theſe ſoul-agonies, and conflicts, that are neceſſarily required to true mortification? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:94897:158"/> of thoſe ſoul-conflicts, wherewith this mortification, or death unto ſin is attended.</p>
                  <p>Now try we the truth of our Mortification by theſe ſigns: Doth it ſpring from a right root of Faith? is it general and univerſal in reſpect of all ſins? is it accompanied with combates? doth the fleſh luſt againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh? and in this combate, doth the ſpirit at laſt prevail, and triumph over the fleſh? do we find it a painfull work both before and after converſion? why, then may I ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>now I know Christ, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings; now by the Grace of Chriſt I am made conformable to his death.</hi> As he died for ſin, ſo I die to ſin; and here is the ground of my hope, that Chriſts death is mine.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, whether we encreaſe and grow in our mortification? this queſtion is needfull as the former, to ſatisfie our ſouls intereſt in the death of Chriſt. As true Grace is growing Grace, ſo true mortification is that which grows: Now that we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in this point alſo, the growth of our mortification will appear by theſe following ſigns.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Growing Mortification hath its chiefeſt conflicts in ſpiritual luſts. At firſt we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie groſſer evils, ſuch as Oaths, Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, worldly-mindedneſs, or the like; but when we grow in this Bleſſed duty, we then ſet our ſelves againſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wickedneſſes; as Pride, Preſumption, Self-carnal confidence in a man's own graces, or the like:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> this Method the Apoſtle ſets down; <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fleſh and ſpirit:</hi> firſt from all filthineſs of the fleſh or body, and then from all filthineſs of the ſpirit or ſoul; as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their entrance into the land of Promiſe, firſt they ſate upon the frontiers and skirts of the Land, and then they ſought it out, and prevailed in the heart of the Country; ſo Chriſtians in their mortification they firſt ſet upon worldly luſts, groſs evils, outward ſins; and when they have encountred them at the frontiers, they then conflict with ſuch corruptions as lie more inwardly, in the very heart, ſpiritual wickedneſſes that are within. Now if this be our caſe, here is one ſign of our growth,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Growing mortification is more, even, conſtant, laſting, durable, when there is in the heart a ſudden flowing and reflowing; it comes from thoſe vaſt Seas of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are within us; many ſouls have their Ague-fits, ſometimes hot, and ſometimes cold; it may be, now they are in a very good frame, and within an hour or two, a mighty Tide comes in and they are born down by ſin and corruption, in this caſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is very weak: But on the contrary, if we find our ſtanding more firm and ſure, if for the main, we walk evenly, and keep cloſely to the Lord, it carries with it an evidence that our mortification grows.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Growing mortification feels Luſt more weak, and the Spirit more ſtrong in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary actings. If we would know the truth of growth, let us look to our uſual fits of ſinning; for then a man's ſtrength or weakneſs is diſcerned moſt: as a man's weakneſs to good is diſcerned when he comes to act it,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note> 
                     <hi>to will is preſent with me, but how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which is good I find not:</hi> ſo a man's weakneſs to ſin is beſt diſcerned, when he comes to act it: Mark then the ordinary fits (as we call them) of ſinning; ſometimes God is pleaſed to appoint ſome more frequent aſſaults, as if he would on purpoſe ſuffer the law of the members to war, and to muſter up all their forces, that ſo we might the rather know what is in our hearts; at ſuch a time, if we find that reſiſtance againſt ſin grows ſtronger, that ſin cannot advance and carry on his Army ſo as formerly, that ſin is encount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Growing mortification hath more ability to abſtain from the very occaſions and beginnings of luſt.<note place="margin">Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:94897:158"/> of a ſtrong hatred; and ſo when a man hates the very garment ſpotted with the fleſh, here's a good ſign: I know this height is not eaſie to attain to, and therefore ſome in imitation of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> have bound themſelves with vows and promiſes, as much as might be, to abſtain from the appearance of evil, to cruſh the Cockatrice Egg before the Serpent could creep out of it, to avoid ſin in its firſt riſe; but alas, how have they bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their vows from time to time?

It is not ſo much for us to ſuffer for Devils (for we are fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures) as it is for Chriſt, God-man, man-God to ſuffer for us: Oh what an hard thing is it, conſidering my enmity againſt Chriſt, to believe that Chriſt died for me, that he gave himſelf to the death, even to the death of the Croſs for my ſoul!</hi>

And that I may perſwade effectually, I ſhall ſay down firſt ſome Directions; and ſecondly, ſome Encouragements of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Directions of Faith in reference to Chriſt's death, obſerve theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith muſt directly go to Chriſt; not firſt to the promiſe, and then to Chriſt; but firſt to Chriſt, and then to the promiſe; the Perſon ever goes before the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith muſt go to Chriſt <hi>as God in the fleſh;</hi> this was the difference betwixt the New-Teſtament, and old-Teſtament-Believers; their Faith directs only to God, but
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:94897:159"/> our Faith looks more immediately to Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith muſt directly go to Chriſt, as God in the fleſh, <hi>made under the Law.</hi> He continued in all things written in the book of the Law to do them; and ſo our Faith muſt look upon him. But of theſe before: I ſhall ſay nothing more to theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith muſt go to Chriſt not only as made under the directive part of the Law by his life, but under the penal part of the Law by his death; in both theſe reſpects <hi>Chriſt was made under the law.</hi> The one half of the Law he ſatisfied by the holineſs of his life; he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the law in every jot and every tittle; the other half of the Law he ſatisfied by his enduring the death, even the death of the Croſs; he paid both the Principal and the Forfeiture; and though men do not ſo, yet Chriſt did ſo, that the whole Law might be ſatisfied fully, by his being under both theſe parts of the Law, pay and penalty: Come then, and look upon Chriſt as dying; it was the Serpent, <hi>as lifted up,</hi> and ſo looked at, that healed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of their fiery ſtings. Alas! we are diſeaſed, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, as they were, and Chriſt Jeſus was lifted up as a remedy to us, as the Serpent was unto them; it remains therefore that as they looked up to the Brazen Serpent, ſo we <hi>look up to Jeſus,</hi> believe in Jeſus, as lifted up for life, and for ſalvation: <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.15.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> Indeed ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt the Serpent and Chriſt.—</p>
                  <p>As, 1. The Brazen Serpent had not power in if ſelf to cure, as Chriſt hath. 2. The Serpent cured the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> but for a time,<note place="margin">John 11.26.</note> to die again; but whomſoever Jeſus cures in a Spiritual ſenſe, he cures for ever; <hi>they ſhall never die.</hi> 3. The ſerpent alſo had its time of curing; it did not alwayes retain its virtue, but during the time they were in the Wilderneſs; only Ieſus Chriſt, our Brazen Serpent, doth ever retain his power and virtue to the end of the world; and hence it is, that in the Miniſtry, Chriſt is ſtill held forth as <hi>lifted up,</hi> that all that will but look on him by faith, may live. 4. The Serpent, ſometimes a remedy againſt poyſon, was after turned even to poyſon the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> which made <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to cruſh it, and brake it, and ſtamp it to powder; but Jeſus Chriſt ever remains the ſovereign and healing God; he is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> He is unchangeable in his goodneſs, as he is in holy and divine nature; he can never be defaced, nor deſtroyed, but he abideth the ſaviour of ſinners to all eternity; why then let us rather <hi>look unto Chriſt, and believe in Chriſt as lifted up, (i.e.)</hi> as he was crucified, and died on the Croſs. In this reſpect he is made a fit object for a ſinner's faith to truſt upon, and reſt upon, <hi>Chriſt as crucified, as made ſin, and a curſe for us, it the object of our pardon.</hi> O this is it that makes Chriſt's death ſo deſirable; why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is virtually and meritoriouſly pardon of ſin, Juſtification, redemption, reconciliation, and what not? <hi>Oh!</hi> cries a ſinner, <hi>where may I ſet my foot? how ſhould I regain my God? my ſin hath undone me, which way ſhould I caſt for pardon?</hi> why now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in ſeeking pardon,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.34.</note> Chriſt was crucified; Chriſt as dying, is principally to be eyed and looked at: <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that dyed,</hi> Rom. 8.34. No Queſtion Chriſts active Obedience, during his Life, was moſt exact, and perfect, and meritorious; yet that was not the expiation of ſin: only his paſſive obedience (Chriſt only in his ſufferings) took away ſin, the guilt of ſin, and puniſhment for ſin; <hi>We have redemption through the blood of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1.7.</note> 
                     <hi>even the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> If any humble ſoul would have recourſe to that Chriſt, who is now in heaven, let him firſt in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Faith, conſider him as crucified, <hi>as lifted up,</hi> as made ſin for us, as through whom (under that conſideration) he is to receive pardon of ſin, Juſtification, redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reconciliation, ſanctification, ſalvation.</p>

As God looks principally to the <hi>meaning of the Spirit</hi> by Prayer, ſo doth faith look principally to the meaning of Chriſt in his ſufferings: miſtake not, my meaning is not that we ſhould be
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:94897:159"/> ignorant of the Hiſtory of Chriſt's death, or of the manner of Chriſt's ſufferings; you ſee we have opened it largely, and followed it cloſe from firſt to laſt; but we muſt not ſtick there; we ſhould above all, look to the mind and heart of Chriſt in all this: ſome obſerve, that both in the Old, and New Teſtament we find this Method; firſt, the Hiſtory, and then the Myſtery; firſt, the Manner, and then the Meaning of Chriſt's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; as in the Old Teſtament.

Now according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the acts of Faith; we muſt firſt <hi>look on Jeſus as lifted up,</hi> and then look at the end and meaning; why was this Jeſus thus <hi>lifted up?</hi> Well, but you may demand, what was the end, the plot, the great deſign of Chriſt in this reſpect?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, ſome ends were remote, and others were more immediate: but omitting all thoſe ends that are remote, his Glory, our Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall only anſwer in theſe Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One deſign of Chriſt's death was to redeem us from the ſlavery of Death and Hell: <hi>He hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us;</hi>

Redeem us! how? not by way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, to ſtep in, and beg our pardon; that would not ſerve the turn: ſold we were, and bought we muſt be; a price muſt be laid down for us, it was a matter of <hi>Redemption;</hi> but with what muſt we be redeemed? ſurely with no eaſie price: ah no, it coſt him dear, and very dear: <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and Gold,</hi>

Heb. 9.26. 1 John 1.7.</note>—<hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſins of the world.—He hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.—Once hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.—And the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> This was the plot, which God by an ancient deſign aimed at in the ſuffering of Jeſus Chriſt; that he would take away ſin: And thus Faith muſt take it up, and look upon it. When <hi>Peter</hi> had ſet forth the hainouſneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſin, in killing Chriſt, he tells them at laſt of that deſign of old; <hi>All this was done,</hi> ſaid he,<note place="margin">Acts 2.2,</note> 
                     <hi>by the determinate counſel of God.</hi> His meaning was firſt to humble them, and then to raiſe them up; <hi>q. d.</hi> It was not ſo much they that wrought his death, as the Decree of God, and the agreement of God and Chriſt: there was an ancient contrivement that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhould die for ſin, and that all our ſins ſhould be laid on the back of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore he ſeems to ſpeak comfort to them in this; that howſoever they deſigned it, yet God and Chriſt deſigned a further end in it than they imagined, even to remiſſion of ſins: <hi>Who was delivered to death for our ſins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note> 
                     <hi>and roſe again for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> The death of Chriſt (as one obſerves) was the greateſt and ſtrangeſt deſign that ever God undertook, and therefore ſure he had an end proportionable to it; God that willeth not the death of a ſinner, would not for any inferior end, will the death of his Son, whom he loved more than all the world beſides; it muſt needs be ſome great matter for which God ſhould contrive the death of his Son; and indeed it could be no leſs than to remove that which he moſt hated, and that was ſin. Here then is another end of Chriſt's death, it was for the remiſſion of ſin one main part of our juſtification.</p>

                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:94897:160"/>3. Another deſign of Chriſt's death was to mortifie our members which are upon the earth. Not only would he remit ſin, but he would deſtroy it, kill it, crucifie it; he would not have it <hi>reign in our mortal bodies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.11. 1 Pet. 2.24.</note> 
                     <hi>that we ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> This Deſign the Apoſtle ſets out in theſe words, <hi>he bare our ſins in his own body upon the Tree, that we being dead unto ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs:</hi> Chriſt by his death had not only a deſign to deliver us from the guilt of ſin, but alſo from the power of ſin: <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> 
                     <hi>ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. Paul</hi> was a mortified man, dead to the world, and dead to ſin: But how came he ſo to be? why this he attributes to the Croſs of Chriſt, to the death of Chriſt; the death of Jeſus was the cauſe of this death in <hi>Paul: How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt—purge our Conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> There is in the death of Chriſt firſt a value, and ſecondly, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; the former is available to our juſtification, the latter to our ſanctification; now ſanctification hath two parts, mortification and vivification: Chriſt's death, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience is more properly conducible to the one; his life, or active obedience to the other.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note> Hence Believers are ſaid to be <hi>engraffed with Chriſt in the likeneſs of his death;</hi> there is a kind of likeneſs betwixt Chriſt and Chriſtians: Chriſt died, and the Chriſtian dies; Chriſt died a natural death, and a Chriſtian dies a ſpiritual death; Chriſt died for ſin, and the Chriſtian dies for ſin; this was another end of the death of Chriſt; there iſſues from his death a mortifying vertue, cauſing the death of ſin in a Believer's ſoul, one main part of our ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>O my ſoul look to this; herein lies the pith and marrow of the death of Chriſt; and if now thou wilt but act and exerciſe thy faith in this reſpect, how mighteſt thou draw the vertue and efficacy of his death into thy ſoul? But here is the queſtion, how ſhould I manage my Faith? or how ſhould I act my faith, to draw down the vertue of Chriſt's death, and ſo to feel the vertue of Chriſt's death in my ſoul, mortifying, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and killing ſin?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 1. In prayer, meditation, ſelf-examination, receiving of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt propound to my ſelf and ſoul the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as having underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and performed that bitter and painful work of ſuffering even unto death; yea, that of the Croſs, as it is held out in the Hiſtory and Narrative of the Goſpel. 2. I muſt really and ſteadfaſtly believe, and firmly aſſent that thoſe ſufferings of Chriſt ſo reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcovered, were real and true, undoubted, and every way unqueſtionable as in themſelves. 3. I muſt look upon thoſe grievous, bitter, cruel, painful, and with all opprobrious, execrable, ſhameful ſufferings of Chriſt, as very ſtrange and wonderful; but eſpecially conſidering the ſpiritual part of his ſufferings, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſenſe and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God's forſaking and afflicting him in the day of his fierce anger, I ſhould even be aſtoniſhed and amazed thereat: what! that the Son of God ſhould lay his head on the block, under the blow of divine Juſtice? that he ſhould put himſelf under the wrath of his heavenly Father? that he ſhould enter into the combat of Gods heavy diſpleaſure, and be deprived of the ſenſe and feeling of his love, and mercy, and wonted comfort? how ſhould I but ſtand agaſt at theſe ſo wonderful ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt? 4. I muſt weigh and conſider what it was that occaſioned and cauſed all this, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin, yea, my Sin, yea, this and that Sin particularly. This comes nearer home, and from this I muſt now gather in theſe ſeveral Concluſions: As,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was the Deſign of Chriſt by his ſufferings to give ſatisfaction to the infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for ſin. 2. It was intended and meant (at leaſt in a ſecond place) to give out to the world a moſt notable and eminent inſtance and demonſtration of the horridneſs, odiouſneſs, and execrableneſs of ſin; ſith no leſs than all this, yea, nothing elſe but this would ſerve the turn to expiate it, and atone for it. 3. It holds forth again, as ſin is horrid in its ſelf, ſo it cannot but be exceeding grievous and offenſive to Chriſt: Oh it coſt him dear, it put him to all this pain and Torture; it made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> how then ſhould it but offend him above all, above any thing in the world? 4. If therefore there be in me any ſpark of love towards Chriſt, or any likeneſs to Chriſt; or if I would have Chriſt to bear any affection, love, regard, or reſpect unto me, it will abſolutely behoove me by all means to loath ſin, and caſt it away from me; to root it up, to quit my hands, and to rid my heart of it. The truth is, I cannot poſſibly give forth a more pregnant proof of my ſincere love, entire affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reſpect, conformity, reſemblance, ſympathy to, and with Chriſt, than by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all violence, uſually all holy ſeverity againſt ſin for his very ſake.</p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:94897:160"/>
                  <p>Now when the heart is thus exerciſed, God by his Spirit will not fail to meet us; our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and endeavour of our ſoul to weaken and kill ſin in the ſoul is not without its reward; but eſpecially when ſin hath in this way, and by this means, loſt the affection of the ſoul, and is brought in hatred, and diſeſteem, it decayes, and dyes of it ſelf; for it only liveth and flouriſheth by the warm affections, good thoughts, and opinion that the ſoul hath of it. So that matters going thus in the heart, the influence that ſhould nouriſh and maintain ſin, is cut off, and it withers by degrees till it be finally, and fully deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Thus for directions; now for the encouragements of our faith to believe in Chriſt's death, conſider—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fulneſs of this object, <hi>Chriſt crucified;</hi> there is a tranſcendent all-ſufficiency in the death of Chriſt: in a ſafe ſenſe it contains in it <hi>univerſal redemption:</hi> it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the redemption of every man in the world, yea, and effectual for all that have been, are, or ſhall be called into the ſtate of grace, whether Jews, or Gentiles, bound or free. I know ſome hold, that Chriſt dyed for all, and every man with a purpoſe to ſave; only thus they explicate. 1. That Chriſt dyed for all men conſidered in the common lapſe or fall, but not as obſtinate, impenitent, or unbelievers; he dyed not for ſuch, as ſuch. 2. That Chriſt dyed for all men in reſpect of the requeſt or impetration of ſalvation, but the application thereof is proper to believers. 3. That Chriſt dyed not to bring all or any man actually to ſalvation, but to purchaſe ſalvabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and reconciliation ſo far, as that God might and would <hi>(ſalva juſtitia)</hi> deal with them on terms of a better covenant. 4. That Chriſt hath purchaſed ſalvability for all men, but faith and regeneration he hath merited for none; becauſe God is bound to give that which Chriſt hath merited of him, although it be not deſired, or craved. I cannot aſſent to theſe poſitions: but thus far I grant, that Chriſt's death in it ſelf is a ſufficient price and ſatisfaction to God for all the world; and that alſo it is effectual in many particulars to all men reſpectively in all the world; every man in one way or other hath the fruit of Chriſt's death conferred upon him; but this fruit is not of one kind; for, 1. Some fruit is common to every man, as the earthly bleſſings which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels enjoy, may be termed the fruits of Chriſt's death. 2. Other fruit is common to all the members of the viſible Church, as, to be called by the Word, to enjoy the Ordinances, to live under the Covenant, to partake of ſome graces that come from Chriſt. 2. Other fruit is indeed peculiar to the Saints of God, as, faith unfeigned, regeneration, pardon of ſin, adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet this fruit is univerſal to all the Saints, whether Jews or Gentiles: in which ſence ſpeaks the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.32. 1 Tim. 2.6. Rom. 11.32. Rom. 5.18. Heb. 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</hi>—And <hi>he gave himſelf a ranſome for all,— and God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all,</hi>—And <hi>by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life;— He taſted of death for all men,</hi> or diſtributively for every man. All which texts are rightly interpreted by <hi>Caiphas, He propheſied that Jeſus ſhould dye for that Nation;</hi>

                     <hi>and not for that Nation only, but that alſo he ſhould gather together in one the children of God, that were ſcattered abroad.</hi> And thus <hi>John</hi> brings in the four beaſts, and four and twenty Elders, ſaying, <hi>Thou art worthy to take the book,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 5.9.</note> 
                     <hi>and to open the ſeals thereof for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</hi> and thus <hi>Paul</hi> rightly argues, <hi>Is he the God of the Jews only?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.29.</note> 
                     <hi>is he not of the Gentiles alſo? yes, of the Gentiles alſo.</hi> O the fulneſs of Chriſt's death!— many are apt to complain, <hi>Would Chriſt dye for me? why alas, I am an alien, I am not of the common-wealth of Iſrael, I am a dog, I am a ſinner, a grievous ſinner,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.13, 14, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>a ſinner of the Gentiles:</hi> And what then? <hi>Ye who ſometimes were afar off, are now made nigh by the blood of Chriſt, for he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle wall of partition between us; that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the croſs.</hi> Oh what encouragement is this for thee to believe thy part in the death of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the worth, the excellency of this glorious object, <hi>Chriſt crucified.</hi> There is an infinite of worth in the death of Chriſt; and this ariſeth, firſt from the dignity of his perſon, he was God-man; the death of Angels and men if put together, could not have amounted to the excellency of Chriſt's death; ſtand amazed at thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; O believer, thou haſt gained by thy loſs, thou haſt loſt the righteouſneſs of a creature, but the righteouſneſs of an infinite perſon is now made thine;<note place="margin">Rom. 10.3. 2 Cor. 5.21.</note> hence it is many times called the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God:</hi> both becauſe Chriſt is God: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94897:161"/> it is ſuch a righteouſneſs as God is ſatisfied with; he looks for no better, yea, there can be no better. 2. This worth is not only in reſpect of the dignity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but alſo in reſpect of the price offered; O it was the blood of Chriſt, one drop whereof is of more worth than thouſands of gold and ſilver.<note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> It was this <hi>blood</hi> that <hi>purchaſed</hi> the whole <hi>Church of God,</hi> which a thouſand worlds of wealth could never have done. 3. This worth is not only in reſpect of the perſon and price neither, but alſo in reſpect of the manner of the oblation;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1 18.</note> Chriſt muſt dye on the Croſs as it was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the price in it ſelf, is not enough, unleſs it be ordered and proportioned accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of him, who is to be ſatisfied; if a man ſhould give for a captive priſoner an infinite ſum of money, ſufficient in it ſelf to redeem a thouſand, yet if not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch a way as the conquerour preſcribeth, if not according to the condition, it could not be called a ſatisfaction; now this was the condition that Chriſt muſt die, and dye that death of the Croſs, and accordingly he undertook, and performed, which ſet a luſtre, and glory, and excellency, and worth upon his death. O the worth, O the excellency of this death of Chriſt!—many are apt to complain, O the filth of my ſins! <hi>Oh the injuries and unkindneſs that have been in mine iniquities! it is not my miſery, my deſtruction that ſo much troubles me, as that God is diſpleaſed.</hi> Sweet ſoul! turn thine eyes hither; ſurely this death of Chriſt is more ſatisfactory to God, than all thy ſins poſſibly can be diſpleaſing to God; there was more ſweet ſavour in Chriſt's ſacrifice, than there could be offence in all thy ſins; the excellency of Chriſt's death in making righteous, doth ſuper-abound the filthineſs of ſin in making a ſinner. Come on then, and cloſe with Chriſt upon this encouragement; there is a dignity, an excellency, in this object of faith, <hi>Chriſt crucified.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

                     <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man ſhould give his life for his friends;—but God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> Why here's an argument of love indeed, how ſhould we but love him, who hath thus loved us? in proſecution of this I have no more to do, but firſt to ſhew Chriſt's love to us, and then to exerciſe our love to him again.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For his love to us; had not God ſaid it, and the Scriptures recorded it, who would have believed our reports? yet Chriſt hath done it, and it is worth our while to weigh it, and conſider it in an holy meditation.—Indeed with what leſs than ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment of Spirit can I behold the Lord Jeſus who from everlaſting was cloathed with Glory and Majeſty, now wrapped in rags, cradled in a manger, expoſed to hunger, thirſt, wearineſs, danger, contempt, poverty, revilings, ſcourgings, perſecution? but to let them paſs: into what extaſies may I be caſt to ſee the Judg of all the world accuſed, judged, condemned? to ſee the Lord of life dying upon the tree of ſhame and curſe? to ſee the eternal Son of God ſtrugling with his Fathers wrath? to ſee him who had ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> ſweating drops of blood in his agony, and crying out on his croſs, <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Oh whither hath his love to mankind carried him? had he only ſent his creatures to ſerve us, had he only ſent his Prophets to adviſe us in the way to Heaven, had he only ſent his Angels from his chamber of preſence to attend upon us, and to miniſter to us, it had been a great deal of mercy; or if it muſt be ſo, had Chriſt come down from Heaven hnmſelf, but only to viſit us, or had he come only and wept over us, ſaying, <hi>Oh that you had known, even you in this your day the things belonging to your peace! Oh that you had more conſidered of my goodneſs! Oh that you had never ſinned!</hi> this would have been ſuch a mercy as that all the world would have wondered at it: but that Chriſt himſelf ſhould come, and lay down his blood, and life, and all for his people; and yet I am not at the loweſt, that he ſhould not only part with life, but part with the ſenſe, and ſweetneſs of God's love, which is a thouſand times better than life,<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than life;</hi> that he ſhould be content to be accurſed, that we might be bleſſed; that he ſhould be content to be forſaken, that we might not be forſaken; that he ſhould be content to be condemned that we might be acquitted; O what rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Spirit can be ſufficient for the admiration of this ſo infinite mercy? be thou ſwallowed up O my ſoul in this depth of Divine love; and hate to ſpend thy thoughts any more upon the baſe objects of this wretched world, when thou haſt ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to take them up.—Come <hi>look on thy Jeſus,</hi> who dyed temporally, that thou mighteſt live eternally: who out of his ſingular tenderneſs would not ſuffer thee to burn in hell, for ten, twenty, thirty, forty, an hundred years, and then reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, by which notwithſtanding he might better and deeper have imprinted in thee the bleſſed memory of a dear Redeemer; no, no, this was the Article betwixt him and his Father, <hi>That thou ſhouldſt never come there;</hi> ſee but, obſerve but Chriſt's love in that mutual agreement betwixt God and Chriſt, <hi>Oh I am preſſed</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>with the ſins of the world as a cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaves, come my Son, either thou muſt ſuffer, or I muſt damn the world:</hi> Accordingly I may imagine the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God to ſpeak to God, <hi>Mercy</hi> cryes, <hi>I am abuſed,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> cryes, <hi>I am deſpiſed;</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> cryes, <hi>I am wronged;</hi> and <hi>Holyneſs</hi> cryes, <hi>I am contradicted;</hi> and all theſe come to the Father for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> crying to him, that <hi>all the world were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of his Grace and Spirit, and if any be ſaved Chriſt muſt be puniſhed.</hi> In this caſe we muſt imagine <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtepped in, <hi>nay rather than ſo,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) I will bear all, and undertake the ſatisfying of all.</hi> And now look upon him! he hangs on the croſs all naked, all torn, all bloody; betwixt Heaven and Earth, as if he were caſt out of Heaven, and alſo rejected by Earth; he hath a Crown indeed, but ſuch a one as few men will touch, none will take from him; and if any raſh man will have it, he muſt tear hair, skin, and all, or it will not come; his hair is all clodded with blood, his face all clouded with black and blew, he is all over ſo pittifully rent, outwards, inwards,

                  <p n="2">2. If this be Chriſt's love to us, what is that love we owe to Chriſt? Oh now for an heart that might be ſome wayes anſwerable to theſe mercies! Oh for a ſoul ſick of love, yea ſick unto death! how ſhould I be otherwiſe, or any leſs affected, this only ſickneſs is our health, this death our life, and not to be thus ſick is to be dead in ſins and treſpaſſes; why, ſurely I have heard enough, for which to love Chriſt for ever. The depths of God's grace are bottomleſs, they paſs our underſtandings, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create our hearts; they give matter of admiration, yet they are not devoid of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: O God raiſe up our ſouls to thee, and if our Spirits be too weak to know thee, make our affections ardent and ſincere to love thee.</p>
                  <p>Surely the death of Chriſt requires this, and calls for this: many other motives we may draw from Chriſt, and many other motives are laid down in the Goſpel, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole Goſpel is no other thing than a motive to draw man to God by the force of God's love to man; in this ſenſe the holy Scriptures may be called <hi>the book of true love,</hi> ſeeing therein God both unfolds his love to us, and alſo binds our love to him; but of all the motives we may draw from Chriſt, and of all the arguments we may find in the Goſpel of Chriſt, there is none to this, the death of Chriſt, the blood of Jeſus: is not this ſuch a love-letter, as never, never was the like? read the words, <hi>For his great love wherewith he loved us,</hi> Epheſ. 2.4. or if you cannot read, obſerve the Hyeroglyphicks, every ſtripe is a letter, every nail is a capital letter, every bruiſe is a black letter, his bleeding wounds are as ſo many rubricks to ſhew upon record: Oh conſider it, is not this a great love? are not all mercies wrapt up in the blood of Chriſt? it may be thou haſt riches, honours, friends, means, Oh but thank the blood of Chriſt for all thou haſt; it may be thou haſt grace, and that is better than corn, or wine, or oyl? Oh but for this thank the blood of Jeſus, ſurely it was the blood of Chriſt that did this for thee; thou waſt a rebellious ſoul, thou haſt an hard and filthy heart, but Chriſt's blood was the fountain opened, and it took away all ſin, and all uncleanneſs; Chriſt in all, and Chriſt above all, and wilt thou not love him? Oh that all our words were words of love, and all our labour, labour of love, and all our thoughts, thoughts of love; that we might ſpeak of love, and muſe of love, and love this Chriſt, who hath firſt loved us, with all our heart, and ſoul, and might! what? wilt thou not love Jeſus Chriſt? let me ask thee then, whom wilt thou love? or rather whom canſt thou love, if thou loveſt not him? if thou ſayeſt, <hi>I love my Friends, Parents, Wife, Children;</hi> Oh but love Chriſt more than theſe; a friend would be an enemy, but that the blood of Chriſt doth frame his heart; a Wife would be a trouble, but that the blood of Chriſt doth frame her heart; all mercies are conveyed to us through this channel; Oh who would not love the Fountain?—conſider of it again and again, our Jeſus thought nothing too good for us, he parts with his life and blood, he parts with the ſenſe and feeling of the love of God, and all this for us, and for our ſakes; Ah my ſoul, how ſhouldſt thou but love him in all things, and by all means?</p>
                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he ſo continually meditated on the great things Chriſt ſuffered for him, that he was brought entirely to love him: and when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, why he would not forſake Chriſt, rather than ſuffer himſelf to be torn and devoured of wild beaſts? he anſwered, that he could not forget him becauſe of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; <hi>Oh his ſufferings</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are not tranſcient words, or removable objects, but they are indelible characters, ſo engraven in my heart, that all the torments of earth can never raze them out.</hi> And being commanded by that bloody Tyrant <hi>Trajane</hi> to be ript and unbowelled, they found <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> written upon his heart in Characters of Gold. Here was an heart worth Gold; Oh that it might be thus with us! If my hands were all of love, that I could work nothing but love; if my eyes were all of love, that I could ſee nothing but love; if my mind were all of love, that I could think of nothing but love; all were too little to love that Chriſt, who hath thus immeaſurably loved me; if I had a thouſand hearts to beſtow on Chriſt, and they moſt enlarged and ſcrued up to the higheſt pitch of affection, all theſe were infinitely ſhort of what I owe to my dread Lord, and deareſt Saviour. Come let's joyn hands, <hi>He loved us, and therefore
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:94897:162"/> let us love him:</hi> if we diſpute the former, I argue from the Jews, when he ſhed but a few tears out of his eyes at <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s grave, <hi>then ſaid the Jews,</hi>

Chriſt was amazed, that we might be cheered: Chriſt was impriſoned, that we might be delivered; Chriſt was accuſed, that we might be acquitted; Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that we might be redeemed; Chriſt ſuffered his Fathers wrath, and came under it, that the victory might be ours, and that in the end we might ſee him face to face in glory: is not here matter of Joy? It may be the Law, and ſin, and juſtice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and death, and hell, may appear as enemies, and diſturb thy comforts; but is there not enough in the blood of Chriſt to chaſe them away?

A man by nature may know thus much, that when he hath ſinned, he muſt ſeek unto God for mercy, but to ſeek unto God for pardon with a price in our hands, to tender up the merits of Jeſus Chriſt for a ſatisfaction to Divine juſtice, here is the myſtery of Faith; and yet I ſpeak not againſt relying on God's mercy for pardon, but what need we to appeal from juſtice to mercy, when by faith we may tender the death of Chriſt, and ſo find acceptance with the juſtice of God it ſelf? come ſoul, and let me tell thee for thy comfort, if thou haſt any ſhare in the death of Chriſt, thou haſt two tenures to hold thy pardon and ſalvation by, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and juſtice; free-grace, and righteouſneſs;</hi> mercy in reſpect of thee, and juſtice in reſpect of Chriſt; not only is free-grace ready to acquit thee, but a full price is laid down to diſcharge thee of all thy ſins: ſo that now when the Prince of this World comes againſt thee, thou mayeſt ſay in ſome ſenſe as Chriſt did. <hi>He can find nothing in me, for how can he accuſe me, ſeeing Chriſt is my Surety? ſeeing the bond hath been ſued, and Chriſt Jeſus would not leave one farthing unpaid?</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Philemon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Oneſimus, if he have wronged thee, or owe thee any thing, put it on my account;</hi> ſo doth Chriſt ſay to God, <hi>if theſe have wronged thy Majeſty, or owe thee any thing, put it on me.

In the effect of it, Chriſts death is the conqueſt of death; Chriſt went down into the grave to make a back-door, that the grave which was before a priſon, might now be a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-fare; ſo that all his Saints may with eaſe paſs through, and ſing, <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. In the graces that moſt eminently ſhined in his bitter paſſion; his life indeed was a gracious life,<note place="margin">John 1.16.</note> he was full of grace, <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace,</hi> but his graces ſhined moſt clearly and brightly at his death; as a Lilly amongſt the Thorns ſeems moſt beautiful, ſo his graces in his ſufferings ſhew moſt excellent; I ſhall inſtance in ſome of them: As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His humility was profound; what? that the moſt high God, that the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and eternal Son of God, ſhould vouchſafe ſo far as to be contemned, and leſs eſteemed than <hi>Barabbas</hi> a murtherer? that Chriſt ſhould be crucified upon a croſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two thieves, as if he had been the ring-leader of all malefactors? O what humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His patience was wonderful; in reſpect of this, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſets Chriſt as a bleſſed example before our eyes; <hi>If when ye do well, and ſuffer for it, ye take it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.20, 21, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>this is acceptable with God, for even hereunto were ye called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that ye ſhould follow his ſteps.— Who when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> O the patience of Chriſt!</p>

                     <note place="margin">1 John 4.10.</note>3. His love was fervent; <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> This love is an examplar of all love; it is the fire that ſhould kindle all our ſparks; <hi>Be ye followers of God</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>as dear children:</hi>

                     <hi>and walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us an offering and ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> Some obſerve, that in the Temple there were two Altars, the brazen, and the golden; the brazen Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar was for bloody Sacrifices, the golden Altar was for the offering of Incenſe; now the former was a type of Chriſt's bloody offering upon the croſs, the latter of Chriſt's ſweet interceſſion for us in his glory; in regard of both, the Apoſtle tells that Chriſt gave himſelf both for an <hi>offering and ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God.</hi> O what love was this!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His mercy was abundant; he took upon him all the miſeries and debts of the world, and he made ſatisfaction for them all; he acted our redemption immediately in his own perſon, he would not intruſt it to Angels, but he would come himſelf and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; nor would he give a low and baſe price for our ſouls, he ſaw the miſery was great, and his mercy ſhould be more great; he would buy us with ſo great a ranſome, as that he might over-buy us, and none might out-bid him in the market of our ſouls; O we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bid, and under-value the mercy of God, who over-valued us; we will not ſell all to buy him, but he ſold all he had, and himſelf too to buy us; indeed if he had not
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:94897:164"/> done it, we had been damned; and to ſave our ſouls, he cared not what he did or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. O the mercy of Chriſt!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His meekneſs was paſſing great; in all the proceſs of his paſſion, he ſhewed not the leaſt paſſion of wrath or anger; he ſuffered himſelf gently and quietly to be carried like a ſheep to the Butchery, and <hi>as a Lamb before ſhearer is dumb, ſo opened he not his mouth:</hi> a Lamb is a moſt meek and innocent creature,<note place="margin">John 1.29.</note> and therefore is Chriſt called <hi>the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi>— And, <hi>he was a brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter;</hi> why, a Lamb goes as quietly to the ſhambles,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.7.</note> as if it were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fold, or to the paſture-field where its Dam ſeedeth; and ſo went Chriſt to his Croſs. O the meekneſs of Chriſt!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. His contempt of the world was to admiration; he tells them,<note place="margin">John 18.36. John 6.15.</note> 
                     <hi>his Kingdom was not of this world.</hi> When a Crown was offered him, and forced upon him, he refuſed it; but above all, behold the Bed where the Bridegroom lieth and ſleepeth at noon-day; here's but an hard flock, and narrow room; O bleſſed head of a dear Redeemer! how is it that thou haſt not a pillow where to reſt thy ſelf? He hangs on the Croſs all naked; few Kings do ſo: he hath no Crown for his head, but one of thorns; he hath no delicates, but Gall and Vinegar; he is leaving the world, and he hath no other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies to give his friends, but ſpiritual things; <hi>Peace I leave with you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.27.</note> 
                     <hi>my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</hi> He had ſo contemned the world, that he had not a Legacy in all the world to give: <hi>Not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. His obedience was conſtant: <hi>He became obedient unto death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.8. John 5.30.</note> 
                     <hi>even the death of the Croſs—He ſought not his own will, but the will of him that ſent him.</hi> There was a command that the Father laid on Chriſt from all eternity: <hi>O my Son, my only begotten Son, thou muſt go down, and leave Heaven, and empty thy ſelf, and die the death, even the death of the Croſs, and go and bring up the fallen ſons of</hi> Adam <hi>out of Hell.</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, like a precious Ring Glory, fell off the Finger of Almighty God, and was broken all in pieces; and thereupon was the command of God, that his Son muſt ſtoop down, though it pain his back; he muſt lift up again the broken Jewel, he muſt reſtore it, and mend it, and ſet it as a Seal on the heart of God; all which the Lord Jeſus did in time; he was obedient till death, and obedient to death, even to the death of the Croſs. <hi>Son, thou muſt die,</hi> ſaid God; <hi>why Father, I will do it,</hi> ſaid Chriſt: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he freely made his Soul an Offering for ſin.</p>
                  <p>Now in all theſe Graces we muſt conform to Chriſt. <hi>Learn of me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11.29. Eph. 5.2.</note> 
                     <hi>for I am meek and lowly.</hi>—And, <hi>walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us:</hi> It is as if Chriſt had ſaid, mark the ſteps where I have trode, and follow me in humility, in patience, in love, in mercy, in meekneſs, in contempt of the world, in obedience unto death; in theſe, and the like Graces you muſt conform unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt conform to Chriſt in his ſufferings, if he call us to them,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.10.</note> this was the Apoſtle's Prayer, <hi>that I may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his ſufferings;</hi> it was his deſire that he might experimentally know what exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy and comfort it was to ſuffer for Chriſt, and with Chriſt. Concerning this, the other Apoſtle ſpeaks alſo, <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21.</note> 
                     <hi>leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> But the Text that ſeems ſo pertinent, and yet ſo difficult, is that of <hi>Paul, I now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1.24.</note> 
                     <hi>and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his bodies ſake, which is the Church:</hi> One would wonder how <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould fill up that which is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt; were Chriſt's ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings imperfect? and much <hi>Paul</hi> add to them? no ſurely? <hi>for by one offering Chriſt hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt on many Commentaries;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note> I ſuppoſe this is the genuine ſenſe and meaning of the Spirit. <hi>Now rejoyce I in my ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for you, whereby I fulfil the meaſure of thoſe tribulations which remain yet to be endured of Chriſt in his myſtical body, which I do for the bodies ſake, not to ſatisfie for it, but to confirm it, or ſtrengthen it by my example in the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> The ſufferings of Chriſt are either perſonal or general; his perſonal ſufferings were thoſe he endured in his own body, as Mediator; which once for ever he finiſhed: his general ſufferings are thoſe which he endures in his myſtical body, which is, the Church; as he is a Member with the reſt; and theſe are the ſufferings <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, and which <hi>Paul</hi> fills up.</p>
                  <p>But wherein is the conformity betwixt our ſufferings, and the ſufferings of Chriſt? I anſwer, 1. Negatively, 2. Poſitively.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="404" facs="tcp:94897:165"/>1. Negatively, our ſufferings have no conformity with Chriſt in theſe two things: 1. Not in the Office of Chriſt's ſufferings; for his were meritorious and ſatisfactory, ours only miniſterial, and for edification. 2. Not in the weight and meaſure of Chriſt's ſufferings; for his were bitter, heavy, and woful, ſuch as would have preſſed any other Creature as low as Hell, and have ſwallowed him up for ever; but ours are but in compariſon light and tollerable: <hi>There hath no temptation taken you but ſuch as is common to man;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> 
                     <hi>for God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Poſitively, our ſufferings muſt have conformity with Chriſt. 1. In the cauſe of them; Chriſt's ſufferings were inſtrumentally from Satan and wicked men; we muſt look to ſuffer by the enemies of Chriſt, if we have any ſhare in Chriſt; the enemy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſtill;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> 
                     <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed.</hi> This was primarily meant betwixt the Devil and Chriſt; but if we conform to Chriſt, we muſt expect the very ſame conditions. 2. In the manner of undergoing them; we muſt ſuffer with a proportion of that humility, and patience, and love, and meekneſs and obedience which Chriſt ſhewed in his very ſufferings. 3. In reſpect of the iſſue of them; we muſt look upon Chriſt's iſſue, and expect it to be ours: <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.26. Rom. 8.17. 2 Tit. 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſo enter into Glory?</hi>—And, <hi>if ſo be that we ſuffer with Chriſt, we ſhall be glorified together with Chriſt.—If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By reaſon of this conformity, we have that communion and aſſociation with Chriſt in all theſe particulars; as, 1. We have Chriſt's ſtrength to bear ſufferings 2. His Victories to overcome ſufferings. 3. His Interceſſion to preſerve us from falling away in ſufferings. 4. His Compaſſion to moderate and proportion our ſufferings to the meaſure of ſtrength which he hath given us. 5. His Spirit to draw in the ſame yoke with us, and to hold us under all ſufferings, that we ſink not. 6. His Graces to be more glorious by our ſufferings, as a Torch, when it is ſhaken, ſhines the brighter. 7. His Crown to reward our ſufferings when we ſhall have taſted our meaſure of them. <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my Soul! ſtudy this conformity, and be content with thy portion; yea, comfort thy ſelf in this condition of ſufferings; muſt we not drink of our Saviour's Cup? what, not of our Maſter's own Cup? We read of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullein,</hi> that he would not be crowned in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a Crown of Gold, where Chriſt was crowned with a Crown of Thorns, becauſe he would not have ſuch a great diſproportion betwixt him and Chriſt: and we read of <hi>Origin,</hi> that when <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the Emperor ſent for him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he might take his choice, whether he would ride thither on a Mule, or in a Chariot, that he refuſed them both, ſaying, <hi>he was leſs than his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Chriſt, of whom he never read that he rode but once.</hi> O the ſufferings Chriſt endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red! he was called a Wine-bibber, a <hi>Samaritane,</hi> a Devil; he was purſued, entrapped, ſnared,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.12.</note> ſlain: And ſurely <hi>they that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi> Never wonder that thou art hated of men, or perſecuted of men; why, I tell thee, if Chriſt himſelf were now amongſt us in the form and faſhion of a ſervant, in that very condition that ſometimes he was, and ſhould convince men of their wickedneſs as ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as ſometimes he did, I verily think he would be the moſt hated man in all the world. It's plain enough what carnal men would do, by theſe very doings of the carnal <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt conform to Chriſt in his death, carrying in us a reſemblance and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of his death. But what death is this? I anſwer in a word, <hi>a death unto ſin;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.10, 11. Rom. 6.5.</note>

As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

Chriſt's death was a voluntary death. <hi>I lay down my life that I may take it again; no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again;</hi> not all men on earth, nor all Devils in Hell could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced Chriſt's death, if he had not pleaſed; his death was a voluntary death, a ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous act; ſo is our mortification: <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may leave their ſins againſt their wills; but this is not true mortification; it bears
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94897:165"/> not in it the likeneſs of Chriſt's death; for he died willingly: it may be thou haſt a cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Conſcience, which continually dogs thee, and therefore thou leaveſt thy ſin; thus <hi>Judas</hi> came in with his thirty pieces of ſilver,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.5.</note> and <hi>caſt them down in the Temple</hi> at the High Prieſt's feet; but no thanks to <hi>Judas,</hi> for they were too hot for him to hold; or it may be there is ſome penalty of the Law, or ſome temporal judgment that hangs over thy head, like <hi>Democles</hi> s ſword, and therefore thou leaveſt thy ſin; thus <hi>Ahab</hi> for a time acts the part of a penitent, but no thanks to <hi>Ahab;</hi> for the Prophet had rung him ſuch a peal for his fin, as made both his ears tingle;<note place="margin">1 King 21.19.</note> 
                     <hi>In the place where dogs licked the blood of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, ſhall dogs lick thy blood, even thine;</hi> or it may be there is in thee a fear of Hell, in thy apprehenſion death is come, and is ready to carry thee before the dreadful Tribunal of a terrible God, and therefore thou leaveſt thy ſin; thus Sea-men in a ſtreſs, part with their goods, not becauſe they are out of love with them, but becauſe they love their lives better; they ſee plainly that either they muſt part with them, or periſh with them. Now in theſe caſes, thy leaving off ſin, bears no ſimilitude with the death of Chriſt; for his death was voluntary, and true mortification is a voluntary action.</p>
                  <p>But may there not be ſome reluctancy in this work betwixt the fleſh and the Spirit?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> and if ſo, is it then voluntary? I anſwer,—</p>
                  <p>Yes, ſuch a reluctancy we find in the humane nature of Chriſt concerning the Cup,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mat. 26.39.</note> that it might <hi>paſs from him,</hi> and yet his death was a true voluntary death. An action is ſaid to be voluntary, or involuntary according to the ſuperior faculties of the Soul, and not according to the inferior; if the reaſonable part be conſenting, the action may be called voluntary, though there be ſome reluctancy in the ſenſitive appetite. Thus in the Chriſtian, in whom there is nature and grace, fleſh and ſpirit, an unregenerate, and a regenerate part, if the ſuperior and better part be willing (I mean adviſedly and deliberately willing, with full conſent of the inward man) though perhaps there may be ſome reluctancy in the fleſh, in the unregenerate part, yet this is ſaid to be a true voluntary act. <hi>So then with the mind, I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.25, 22, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>but with my fleſh the Law of ſin.—I delight in the Law of God after the inward man; but I ſee another Law in my members, warring againſt the Law of my mind. Paul</hi> was dead to ſin according to the inward man, the regenerate part, though he found a reluctancy in his outwards members; and therefore his death to ſin carried with it the reſemblance of the death of Chriſt, it was a voluntary death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt's death was a violent death; he died not naturally, but violently;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18. Iſa. 53.7.</note> 
                     <hi>he was put to death in the fleſh, he was brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter.</hi> So is our mortification, it is voluntary in reſpect of us, but violent in reſpect of ſin; and herein is the life (as I may ſay) of this death: Oh when a man layes violent hands on his ſins; when he cuts them off, being yet in their flower, and ſtrength, and power, and vigor; when he pulls up thoſe weeds before they whither in themſelves, this is true mortification: many have left their ſins, who never mortified them; ſo the aged Adulterer hath left his Luſt, becauſe his body is dead: and hence it is that <hi>late repentance in an aged ſinner is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found true:</hi> alas, he dies not to ſin, but his ſin dies to him: I will not ſay but God may call at the eleventh hour, though it be very ſeldom; but in that caſe you had need to be jealous over your ſelves with a godly jealouſie: what, do you find ſome ſins within you to be dead, that were ſometimes alive? O be inquiſitive, impannel a Jury, call a Coroners Inqueſt upon your own ſouls, enquire how they came by their deaths; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they died a violent or natural death? ſearch what wounds they have received, and whether they were deadly wounds, yea, or no? enquire what weapon it was that ſlew them, whether the Sword of the Spirit, that two-edged Sword, the Word of God? what purpoſes, what reſolutions have been taken up, and levelled againſt them? what prayers and tears have been ſpent upon them?

                  <p>For the Query, what is the cauſe of this conformity? I anſwer, The death of Chriſt is the cauſe of this conformity: And that a fourfold cauſe.—</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5.25, 26, 27.</note>1. It is a meritorious cauſe; Chriſt's death was of ſo great a price, that it deſerved at God's hands our conformity to Chriſt. <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that by his death he might ſanctifie it, and cleanſe it:—and preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21.</note>2. It is an exemplary cauſe: <hi>He ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps;</hi> he died for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould die to ſin, as he died for ſin, we may obſerve in many particulars (beſides thoſe I have named) a proportion, analogy, and likeneſs betwixt Chriſt's death and ours; Chriſt died as a ſervant, to note that ſin ſhould not rule, or reign over us; Chriſt died as a curſe, to note that we ſhould look upon ſin as a curſed thing; Chriſt was faſt nayled on the Croſs, to note that we ſhould put ſin out of caſe, yea, crucifie the whole body of ſin: Chriſt died not preſently, yet there he hung till he died, to note that we ſhould never give over ſubduing ſin, while it hath any life or working in us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an efficient cauſe, it works this conformity by a ſecret virtue iſſuing from it. Thus Chriſtians are ſaid to be <hi>engraffed with Chriſt in the likene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, there is a twofold mortification, the one habitual, the other practical;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the former conſiſts in a change of the heart, turning the bent and inclination of the heart from all manner of ſin; now this is the only and immediate work of the Spirit of Grace, breathing and working where it will; the latter conſiſts in the exerciſe of putting forth of that inward grace, in the acting of that principle, in reſiſting temptations, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing inordinate Luſts, in watching againſt ſinful and inordinate acts; now this is the work of a regenerate perſon, himſelf co-operating with the Spirit of God, as a rational inſtrument with the principal Agent, and therefore the Apoſtle joins both together; <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds of the Body,</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. It is an impelling, or a moving cauſe, as all objects are; for objects have an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power. <hi>Achan</hi> ſaw the wedge of Gold, and then coveted it: <hi>David</hi> ſaw <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> and then deſired her.

                     <hi>will draw all men to me.</hi>—Thus of the cauſes of our conformity; we ſee how it is wrought.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the laſt Query; what are the means of this conformity as on our part? I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Go to the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt. It is not all our purpoſes, reſolutions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, vows, covenants endeavours, without this, that will effect our conformity to Chriſt in his ſufferings and death; no, no, this conformity is a fruit and effect of the death of Chriſt; and therefore whoſoever would have this work wrought in him, let him firſt have recourſe to Chriſt's Croſs: O go we more immediately to the Croſs of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Look up to him that hangs upon it, contemplate the death of Jeſus Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly and ſadly his bitter ſhameful, painful ſufferings: Much hath been ſaid, only here draw it into ſome Epitome: As, 1. Conſider who he was. 2. What he ſuffered. 3. Why he ſuffered. 4. For whom he ſuffered. 5. For what end he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. 6. With what mind he ſuffered: Every one of theſe will make ſome diſcoveries either of his Graces, or of his gracious actings in our behalf; and who can tell how far this very <hi>Look</hi> may work on us to change us, and transform us into the very image of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us humbly bewail our defect, exorbitancy, irregularity, and inconformity either to the graces, ſufferings, or death of Chriſt. As thus; <hi>Lo here the profound humility, wonderful patience, fervent love, abundant mercy, admirable meekneſs, conſtant obedience of Jeſus Chriſt! Lo here the tortures, torments, agonies, conflicts, extream ſufferings of Chriſt for the ſpiritual, immortal good of the preciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt in his ſufferings ſhined with graces, his graces appeared in his ſufferings, like ſo many ſtars in a bright winter's night; but how dim are the faint weak Graces in my Soul? Chriſt in his ſufferings endured
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:94897:167"/> much for me, I know not how much; by thine unknown ſorrows and ſufferings felt by thee' but not diſtinctly known to us (ſaid the ancient Fathers of the Greek Church, in their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy) have mercy upon us, and ſave us; his ſorrows and ſufferings were ſo great, that ſome think it dangerous to define them; but how poor, how little are my ſufferings for Jeſus Chriſt? I have not yet reſiſted unto blood, and if I had, what were this in compariſon of his extream ſufferings? Chriſt in his ſufferings died; his paſſive obedience was unto death, even to the death of the Croſs: he hung on the Croſs till he bowed his head, and gave up the Ghoſt;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.10.</note> 
                     <hi>he died unto ſin once: But alas! how do I live in that for which he died? To this day my ſin hath not given up the Ghoſt; to this day the death of Chriſt is not the death of my ſin: O my ſin is not yet crucified; the heart-blood of my ſin is not yet let out: Oh wo is me, how unanſwerable am I to Chriſt in all theſe reſpects?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us quicken, provoke, and rouze up our Souls to this conformity; let us ſet before them exciting Arguments, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> The greateſt glory that a Chriſtian can attain to in this world, is to have a reſemblance, and likeneſs to Jeſus Chriſt. Again, the more like we are to Chriſt, the more we are in the love of God, and the better he is pleaſed with us: It was his voice concerning his Son, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> and for his ſake, if we are but like him, he is alſo well pleaſed with us. Again, a likeneſs or reſemblance of Chriſt is that which keeps Chriſt alive in the world: As we ſay of a child that is like his Father, <hi>This man cannot die ſo long as his Son is alive:</hi> So we may ſay of Chriſtians who reſemble Chriſt, that ſo long as they are in the world, Chriſt cannot die; he lives in them, and he is no otherwiſe alive in this nether world, than in the hearts of Gracious Chriſtians, that carry the picture and reſemblance of him. Again, a likeneſs to Chriſt in his death, will cauſe a likeneſs to Chriſt in his Glory, <hi>If we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note> 
                     <hi>we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection:</hi> As it is betwixt the Graft and the Stock, the Graft ſeeming dead with the Stock in the winter, it revives with it in the Spring; after the Winter's death, it partakes of the Spring's reſurrection; ſo it is betwixt Chriſt and us; if with Chriſt we die to ſin, we ſhall with Chriſt be raiſed to Glory; being conformed to him in his death, we ſhall be alſo in his reſurrection. Thus let us quicken and provoke our ſouls to this conformity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us pray to God that he will make us conformable to Jeſus Chriſt. Is it Grace we want? let us beg of him, that of that fulneſs that is in Chriſt, we may in our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure receive grace for grace. Is it patience, or joy in ſufferings that we want? let us beg of him, that as he hath promiſed, he will ſend us the comforter, that ſo we may follow Chriſt chearfully from his croſs to his crown, from earth to heaven. Is it morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication our ſouls pant after? this indeed makes us moſt like to Chriſt in his ſufferings and death; why then pray we for this mortification.—</p>
                  <p>But, how ſhould we pray? I anſwer, 1. Let us plainly acknowledge, and heartily bemoan our ſelves in God's boſom for our ſins, our abominable ſins. 2. Let us confeſs our weakneſs, feebleneſs, and inability in our ſelves to ſubdue our ſins: <hi>we have no might</hi> (may we ſay) <hi>againſt this great company that come againſt us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chr. 20.12.</note> 
                     <hi>neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> 3. Let us put up our requeſt, begging help from heaven, let us cry to God that vertue may come out of Chriſt's death to mortifie our Luſts, to heal our Natures, to ſtanch our bloody iſſues; and that the Spirit may come into helps us in theſe works:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> 
                     <hi>for by the Spirit do we mortifie the deeds of the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us preſs God with the merits of Chriſt, and with his promiſes through Chriſt; for he hath ſaid, <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over us; for we are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.14. Rom. 8.2.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> experienced it, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt hath freed me from the Law of ſin and death.</hi> 5. Let us praiſe God, and thank God for the help already received, if we find that we have gotten ſome power againſt ſin, that we have gotten more ability to oppoſe the luſts of the fleſh, that we are ſeldom overtaken with any breaking forth of it, that we have been able to withſtand ſome notable temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to it, that the force of it in us is in any meaſure abated, that indeed and in truth vertue is gone out of the death of Chriſt: Oh then return we praiſes to God, let us tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in God, let us lead our captivity captive, and ſing new ſongs of praiſes unto God, and even ride in triumph over our corruptions, boaſting our ſelves in God, and ſetting up our Banners in the name of the moſt High, and offering up humble and hearty thanks to our Father for the death of Chriſt, and for the merit, vertue, and efficacy of it derived unto us, and beſtowed upon us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let us frequently return to our <hi>looking up unto Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to our believing in Chriſt
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:94897:167"/> as he was <hi>lifted up.</hi> How we are to manage our Faith, to draw down the vertue of Chriſt's death into our ſouls, I have diſcovered before; and let us now be in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe rules; certainly there is a conveyance of an healing, ſtrengthning, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue flowing into the Soul in the time of its viewing, eying, contemplating, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon Chriſt crucified, Chriſt <hi>lifted up;</hi> and this comes from the ſecret preſence of God, bleſſing this our <hi>looking upon Chriſt,</hi> as the Ordinance by which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make an effectual impreſſion upon the heart. It is not for us curiouſly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how this ſhould be: <hi>Principles</hi> (we ſay) <hi>are not to be proved;</hi> ſave only God hath ſaid it, and experience hath found it out, that when Faith is occaſioned to act on any ſutable ſacred object, God by his Spirit doth not fail to anſwer, in ſuch a caſe he fills the Soul with comfort, bleſſing, vertue; he returns upon the Soul (by, from, and through the actings of Faith) whatſoever by it is looked for. Indeed none knoweth this, but he that feels it; and none feels this that knoweth how to expreſs it; as there is ſomewhat in the fire <hi>(heat, warmth and light)</hi> which no Painter can expreſs; and as there is ſomewhat in the face <hi>(heat, warmth and life)</hi> which no Limner can ſet forth; ſo there is ſomewhat flowing into the ſoul, while it is acting faith on the Death of Chriſt, which, for the riſe, or way, or manner of its working, is beyond what tongue can ſpeak, or pen can write, or pencil can delineate. Come then, if we would have grace, endure afflictions, die to ſin, grow in our mortification: let us again and again return to our duty of <hi>looking unto Jeſus,</hi> or believing in Jeſus, as he was <hi>lifted up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet when all is done, let us not think that ſin will die or ceaſe in us altogether; for that is an higher perfection than this life will bear; only in the uſe of the means, and through God's bleſſing, we may expect thus far, that ſin ſhall not reign, it ſhall not wear a Crown, it ſhall not ſit in the Throne, it ſhall hold no Parliaments, it ſhall give no laws within us; we ſhall not ſerve it, but we ſhall die to the dominion of it, by vertue of this Death of Jeſus Chriſt. And this, He grant who died for us; <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far we have <hi>looked on Jeſus</hi> as our <hi>Jeſus;</hi> in his ſufferings and death. Our next work is to <hi>look on Jeſus</hi> carrying on the great work of our Salvation during the time of his Reſurrection, and abode upon earth, until his Aſcenſion, or taking up to Heaven.</p>

                  <p>I dare not be too curious, in giving reaſons for this ſet time; and the rather, becauſe Chriſt is a free worker of his own affairs; he doth what he pleaſeth, and when he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; times and actions are in his own power, and he needs not to give us any account of them; and yet ſo far as Scripture diſcovers; we may go along; and amongſt many others, <hi>I</hi> ſhall lay down theſe following Reaſons.—</p>

                  <p n="2">2. WHy he roſe, we have theſe Reaſons.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he might powerfully convince, or confound his adverſaries; they that crucified him were mightily afraid of his Reſurrection; they could tell <hi>Pilate, Sir, we remember this deceiver ſaid while he was yet alive, after three days I will riſe again;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 27.63, 64.</note> and therefore they deſire him of all loves <hi>to command the Sepulchre to be made ſure until the third day;</hi> if ever he riſe again whom they have killed, then they knew they were all ſhamed; then <hi>the laſt errour</hi> (as they ſaid) <hi>would be worſe than the firſt:</hi> All the world would look on them as a curſed generation, to kill the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to crucifie ſuch a one as after his death and burial ſhould riſe again; now then, that he might either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, or confound them, notwithſtanding their care, their watch, their Seal, their making all ſure as poſſibly they could; at the very ſame time he told them before, he broke open the gates of death, and made the gates of Braſs to flie aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he might confirm the faith of all his followers. <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.14.</note> 
                     <hi>your Faith is vain,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Chriſts reſurrection both confirms our faith, as to his perſon and to his office: for his perſon;<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> this ſpeaks him to be the <hi>eternal Son of God, by the reſurrection from the dead:</hi> and for his office; this ſpeaks him to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the great Prophet, the chief high Prieſt, the King and Saviour of his Church. When the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw Chriſt purging the Temple, and <hi>Meſſiah</hi>-like reforming what he ſaw amiſs in the Houſe of God, <hi>What ſign</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſheweſt thou unto us,</hi>

                     <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou doſt theſe things?

That it might clearly appear, that he had fully ſatisfied the juſtice of God for ſin: So it was, that God laid the forfeiture of the bond on Chriſt; he arreſted him, brought him to the Goal, the Grave, and there he was till the Debt was paid to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing; and then, that it might clearly appear that the bond was cancelled, the Priſoner diſcharged, God's juſtice ſatisfied, he roſe again from the dead. Some make a queſtion when his Bond was cancelled? and they ſay, as the debt was paid, ſo the Bond was cancelled ere he ſtirred off the Croſs (only by the Croſs, I ſuppoſe they mean the utmoſt degree of Chriſts humiliation, <hi>viz.</hi> his being held in captivity and bondage under death) and ſo <hi>the hand-writing of the Law that was againſt us,</hi> was there deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and there he <hi>blotted it out, cancelled it, took it out of the way,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>nailing it to his Croſs.</hi> Others think, that as to the full diſcharge of a debt, and freeing the debtor, two things are requiſite; firſt, the payment of the debt: ſecondly, the tearing, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling of the bond; ſo the payment was wrought by Chriſt's death, and the cancelling of the Bond was at his reſurrection; I ſhall not diſprove either of theſe: I am ſure, this is without all controverſie, that Chriſt roſe, that it might fully appear that now the Bond was cancelled, and Gods Juſtice ſatisfied.</p>

                     <hi>O death where is thy sting?

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.20.</note>5. That he might <hi>become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept.</hi> Chriſt is called the firſt-fruits in a double reſpect, 1. In reſpect of the day whereon he roſe; <hi>Paul</hi> was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent critick, the very feaſt carryed him to the word; as the day of his paſſion was the day of the paſſeover, and the Apoſtle thence could ſay, <hi>Chriſt is our paſſeover;</hi> 1 Cor. 15.7.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7. 1 Cor. 15.20. Lev. 22.10, 11.</note> So the day of Chriſt's riſing was the day of the firſt-fruits, and the Apoſtle thence could ſay, <hi>Chriſt is our firſt-fruits.</hi> Concerning this feaſt of the firſt fruits we read <hi>Lev.</hi> 22.10, 11. It was their firſt harveſt of their baſeſt grain Barley, but the full harveſt of their beſt grain of Wheat, was not till pentecoſt. Now upon this day, the morrow after the Sabbath, the beginning of their firſt harveſt, when the ſheaf of their firſt-fruits was brought unto the Prieſt, and waved before the Lord, Chriſt aroſe from the dead, and in this reſpect <hi>Paul</hi> calls him the <hi>firſt fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> of all the Saints.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.20.</note> He aroſe firſt as on this day, for the full Harveſt is not till doomes-day, the general Reſurrection day. 2. he is called the firſt-fruits in reſpect of them whom he thereby ſanctified: for as an handful of <hi>the firſt-fruits</hi> ſanctified the whole Field of corn that was growing; ſo Jeſus Chriſt the firſt-fruits of the dead, ſanctifies all thoſe who are lying in the grave to riſe again by his Power, even when they are in the duſt of death.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye are yet in your ſins.—But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. HOw he roſe; for the manner of his reſurrection we may conſider in it theſe particulars.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt roſe again as a common Perſon, he ſtood in our ſtead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he roſe from death, we and all the Church of Chriſt roſe together with him, and in him. We have formerly obſerved that Chriſt took upon him the Perſon of no man, he took only the nature of man into the union of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon, that ſo he might dye and riſe again, not as a Particular but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Perſon; that he might be as a repreſentative in our room and ſtead; that he might be as a Spiritual head, and as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who could infuſe life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his members. In this reſpect the Apoſtle makes compariſon betwixt <hi>Adam,</hi> and Chriſt; now <hi>Adam,</hi> we know, was reckoned before his fall as, a common publick Perſon, not ſtanding ſingly or alone for himſelf, but as repreſenting all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde to come of him; ſo Jeſus Chriſt is reckoned to us, both before his death, and in his death and after his death, as a common publick Perſon; not living, dying, or riſing again, ſingly, or alone for himſelf, but as repreſenting all the believers in the world; and hence it is that <hi>Adam</hi> is called the <hi>firſt man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47.</note> and Jeſus Chriſt is called <hi>the ſecond man;</hi> as if there never had been, nor ever ſhould be any more men in the world, ſave only theſe two; and why? but becauſe theſe two between them had all the reſt of the Sons of men hanging at their girdles: <hi>Adam</hi> had all the Sons of men born into this world called <hi>earthly men,</hi> included in him; and Chriſt had all his elect, whoſe names are written in heaven, and therefore called <hi>Heavenly men,</hi> included in him; ſo that now whatſoever Chriſt did, it is reckoned by God as if done by us and for us. When Chriſt aroſe, he aroſe as our head, and as a common Perſon, and in God's account we aroſe with him, and in him. As among all the ſheaves in the Field, there was ſome one ſheaf, that in the name and room of all the reſt was lift up, and waved before the Lord; ſo when all were dead, Chriſt as the <hi>first-fruits</hi> roſe again from the dead, and by this act of his reſurrection all the Elect from the beginning of the World to the end, are riſen with him and in him. <hi>He is the firſt fruits of them that ſleep,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.20.</note> though the Saints are a ſleep, yet are they vertually riſen already with Chriſt, becauſe he is their firſt-fruits. Let this ever be remembred, that Chriſt roſe again as the firſt-fruits, as the ſecond man, as an head, as a common Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſt roſe again by his own Power, this he meant when he ſaid,<note place="margin">John 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up.</hi> He ſaith not, deſtroy, you, and ſome other ſhall raiſe it up; no, no; but I, even I my ſelf will do it; yea, and I will do it, by my own Power and vertue; here is a plain argument of the Divine nature of Chriſt, for none ever did, ever could do that but God himſelf; ſome were raiſed before Chriſt was incarnate, but not any by himſelf, or by his own proper Power; only a Power was imparted to ſome Prophet by God for that time and turn, and ſo they were raiſed: but Chriſt roſe again not by a Power imparted to ſome, but by his own Power. The Widows ſon of <hi>Sarephtah</hi> was raiſed by <hi>Elias;</hi> and the <hi>Shunamites</hi> ſon was raiſed by <hi>Eliſha;</hi> both theſe were raiſed by others, and thoſe others that raiſed them, did it not by their own power, but by a power given them from above; and therefore though in their life-time they raiſed others, yet being dead they could not raiſe themſelves; but Jeſus Chriſt did not only in his life-time raiſe others, but alſo being dead, and laid in his grave, and preſſed with ſtones, and watched by Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſought to be deteined by all the Power of darkneſs, yet he as a conqueror, by his own Power raiſed himſelf; he cauſed all things by the ſtrength of his own arme to give way unto himſelf, <hi>I have Power to lay down my life, and I have Power to take it up again;</hi> an equal Power to take it up, as to lay it down.<note place="margin">John. 10.18.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But againſt this it may be objected, <hi>The God of our Fathers raiſed up Jeſus,</hi>

I anſwer, both in time and efficacy. 1. In time; he roſe to eternal life the firſt of all men.

Chriſt was the firſt of all that roſe to eternal life; never any in the world roſe, before Chriſt, in this manner. 2. In reſpect of efficacy, Chriſt roſe firſt, that by his power all the reſt might riſe; there is in Chriſt's reſurrection a reviving and a quickning vertue; and herein is a main difference betwixt the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and the Reſurrection of any other man; the Reſurrection of <hi>Abraham</hi> availes nothing to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of <hi>Iſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is a queſtion what became of thoſe bodies which now aroſe: Some think they died again; but it is more probable, that ſeeing they roſe to manifeſt the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue of Chriſt's reſurrection, that they were alſo glorified with Chriſt; and as they roſe with Chriſt ariſing, ſo they aſcended up into heaven with Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That Chriſt roſe again with a true, perfect, incorruptible, powerful, ſpiritual, agile, and glorious body.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He had a true body, conſiſting of fleſh and blood, and bone; ſo he told his Diſciples, when they ſuppoſed him a Spirit; <hi>Handle me,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. He had a perfect body; however he was cut, and bored, and mangled before his death, yet after his reſurrection, all was perfect. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells of one of the Children of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> that were put to death for the profeſſion of the Truth; and when they cut off his members, ſaies he, <hi>I have received theſe from heaven, and now I do give them unto the God of heaven, and I hope I ſhall have them again.</hi> Not a member of Chriſt was wanting, not a bone out of joint, but all was perfect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He had an incorruptible, immortal body. To this end (ſaith the Apoſtle) Chriſt both died, and roſe and revived; and why revived? but to ſhew that he roſe, never to die again. The Apoſtle is yet more expreſs; <hi>Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</hi> Conſonant hereunto is that of Chriſt, <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. He had a ſpiritual body; it needed not to meat, drink or refreſhings, as it did before; it is true, that the Diſciples <hi>gave him a piece of a broiled fiſh,</hi>

Let the ordinary Profeſſors of our times, who are of weak judgments, and fiery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, look to this point, leaſt as now, when they cannot anſwer a Separatiſt, they turn Separatiſts, and when they cannot anſwer an Antinomian, they turn Antinomians, and when they cannot anſwer a Seeker, Quaker, Blaſphemer, they turn to them, ſo when they cannot anſwer the ſubtle Arguments of a Jew, they ſhould as eaſily turn Jews, and deny Chriſt, and the reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I mean not to enter into controverſies; only I ſhall declare from what heads, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this nature may be drawn. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. More generally from Gentiles grants; Jews conceſſions, typical inſtructions, prophetical predictions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. More ſpecially from theſe clear demonſtrations, that circumſtantially and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially do prove this Chriſt to have riſen again.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. the Arguments in general are—</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

And to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Sybylla</hi> left written theſe very words, <hi>He ſhall end the neceſſity of death by three dayes ſleep, and then returning from death to life again, he ſhall be the firſt that ſhall ſhew the beginning of reſurrection to his choſen, for that by conquering death, he ſhall bring us life.</hi>
                  </p>

For the firſt, They ſerved four hundred years in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for the ſecond, They wandred forty years in the wilderneſs; for the third, They were captives ſeventy years in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and for the fourth, They are held in pitiful captivity even till this day. 8. The laſt Argument on which only I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, it is the ſeveral Apparitions that <hi>Chriſt</hi> made to others after his Reſurrection, ſome reckon them ten times, others eleven times, and others twelve times, according to the number of his twelve Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.34.</note>1. He appeared unto <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> apart. As a woman was the firſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death, ſo was a woman the firſt Meſſenger of Life; ſhe brought the firſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the ſureſt Argument of man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  </p>

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94897:173"/> the one was <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and probable it is, the other was <hi>Luke,</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. He appeared unto the ten Apoſtles, when the doors were ſhut. Some controverſie there is in this, becauſe the Evangeliſt ſaith expreſly,<note place="margin">Luke. 24.33. ver. 36. John 20.24.</note> that <hi>the eleven Diſciples were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together—and as they ſpake, Jeſus himſelf ſtood in the midst of them.</hi> Now <hi>Judas</hi> was hanged, and <hi>Matthias</hi> was not elected, and <hi>Thomas Didimus</hi> was not with them when Jeſus came: how then could he appear to eleven Apoſtles, conſidering at at this time there were but eleven in all?—Some ſay it is a certain number put for an uncertain. Others ſay, that the eleven might be together when the two Diſciples came, and when Jeſus came, <hi>Thomas</hi> might be abſent, and gone from amongſt them. And if the Text be viewed well, there is no contradiction in this ſaying, But I muſt not dwell on controverſial points.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He appeared to all the Diſciples, <hi>and Thomas was with them;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 20.26.</note> and then he ſhewed them his wounds, to ſtrengthen the weak faith of his wavering ſervants. <hi>Thomas</hi> would not have believed unleſs he had ſeen, and therefore Chriſt ſhews him the wounds of his body, that he might cure the wounds of <hi>Thomas</hi>'s unbelieving ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He appeared to <hi>Peter, and John, and James, and Nathaniel, and Didimus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 21.2.</note> 
                     <hi>and two other Diſciples,</hi> when they were a fiſhing at the ſea of <hi>Tiberias;</hi> there he proved the verity of his Deity by that miracle of the fiſhes, and the verity of his humanity by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meat with them.<note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>And this was the third time that he ſhewed himſelf</hi> publickly and ſolemnly unto all, or to the moſt part of <hi>his Diſciples.</hi>

But <hi>Mary</hi> ſtood there weeping, when Chriſt ſtood at <hi>Lazarus's</hi> grave-ſide weeping, the Jews ſaid then, <hi>Behold how he loved him,</hi> and may not we ſay the very ſame of <hi>Mary, Behold how ſhe loved him,</hi> her very love runs down her cheeks, ſhe cannot think of Jeſus as loſt, but ſhe weeps; ſhe weeps for having loſt him whom ſhe loved; at firſt ſhe mourned for the departing of his ſoul out of his body, and now ſhe laments the taking his body out of the grave; at firſt ſhe mourned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe could not keep him alive, yet that ſorrow had ſome ſolace, in that ſhe hoped to have enjoyed him dead; but when ſhe conſiders that his life was loſt, and not ſo much as his body could be found, Oh ſhe weeps, and weeps. The laſt office ſhe could do, was to anoint his body, and to bewail his death; and to that purpoſe ſhe comes now unto his grave; as ſometimes ſhe had waſhed his feet with her tears, now ſhe would ſhed them afreſh upon his feet, and head, and hands, and heart, and all; but when ſhe ſaw the grave open; and the body gone, and nothing of Chriſt now left her to mourn over, ſhe weeps the more, ſhe weeps moſt bitterly; <hi>But Mary ſtood there weeping.</hi>

                     <hi>and the napkin that was about his head wrapt by it ſelf;</hi> and yet for all this ſhe will be ſtooping down, and looking in; ſhe would rather condemn her own eyes of error, and both their eyes and hands of deceit; ſhe would rather ſuſpect all teſtimonies for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, than not to look after him whom ſhe had loſt, even there where by no diligence he could be found. <hi>It is not enough for love to look in once.</hi> You know this is the manner of our ſeeking, when we ſeek ſomething ſeriouſly; where we have ſought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, there we will ſeek again; we are apt to think we ſought not well, but if we ſeek again we might find it were we ſought: And thus <hi>Mary</hi> ſought, and when ſhe could think of no other place ſo likely to find Chriſt in as this, ſhe ſought again in this, ſhe will not believe her own ſenſes, ſhe would rather think that ſhe looked not well before, than ſhe will leave off looking. When things that are dearly affected are gone and loſt, loves nature is never to be weary of ſearching, even the ofteneſt ſearched corners; they muſt ſtill be an haunt for hope. O love thinks it hath never looked enough! in the firſt verſe ſhe looked, <hi>And ſaw the ſtone taken away from the Sepulchre;</hi> and now again <hi>ſhe ſtooped down, and looked into the Sepulchre.</hi>

                     <hi>the one at the head, and the other at the feet where the body of Jeſus had layen.</hi> I will not ſtay here, only for the opening of the words I ſhall anſwer theſe queſtions; As 1. What means the apparition of Angels? I anſwer, it is not only a preparation to Chriſt's apparition. <hi>Maries</hi> loſs muſt be reſtored by degrees; though ſhe ſaw not Chriſt at firſt; yet ſhe ſaw his Angels; it often pleaſeth Chriſt in the deſertions of his people, to come to them by degrees, and not at once, he comes firſt by his Angels; ſo it was at his birth, and ſo it is at his reſurrection.—But, 2. What do Angels in a Sepulchre? it is a place fitter for worms than Angels: we never read of Angels being in a grave before this time; they are bleſſed creatures, and is the grave a fit place for them? O yes! ſince Chriſt lay in the grave, that very place is a bleſſed place; <hi>Bleſſed are the dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 14.13. Pſal. 116.15.</note> 
                     <hi>which dye in the Lord from henceforth. Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi> But, 3. Why are the Angels in white? <hi>Solomon</hi> anſwers, that white is the colour of joy. <hi>Let thy garments be alwayes white, and let thy head lack no ointment.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.8. Mark 9.3.

Why are they one at the head, and the other at the feet where the body of Jeſus had layen? Some anſwer, that as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had anointed his head and feet, ſo at thoſe two places the two Angels ſit; as it were to acknowledg ſo much for her ſake. Others think it ſpeaks comfort to every one of us; if we are but in Chriſt, we ſhall go to our graves in white, and lye between two Angels, who are ſaid to guard
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:94897:175"/> our Bodies even dead, and to preſent them alive again at the day of the reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>But in this apparition we ſee further, a queſtion, and anſwer; 1. The Angels que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <hi>Mary, Woman why weepeſt thou?</hi> May I paraphraſe upon theſe words? it is as if they had ſaid, <hi>O Mary!</hi> what cauſe is there for theſe tears? where Angels rejoyce, it agrees not that a woman ſhould weep; thou couldſt before with a manly courage arm thy feet to run among ſwords when thou cameſt to the grave, and art thou now ſo much a woman that thou canſt not command thine eyes to forbear tears? <hi>O woman, why weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou?</hi> If thy Chriſt were here in his grave, under this Tomb-ſtone, we might think thy ſorrow for the dead enforced thy tears, but now that thou findeſt it a place of the living, why doſt thou ſtand here weeping dead? for if thy tears be tears of love, as thy love is acknowledged, ſo let theſe tears be ſuppreſſed; if thy tears be tears of anger, they ſhould not here have been ſhed, where all anger was buried; if thy tears be tears of ſorrow and duties to the dead, they are beſtowed in vain where the dead is now revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and therefore, <hi>O woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> would our eyes be dry, if ſuch eye-ſtreames were behoveful for us? did not Angels alwayes in their viſible reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances repreſent their Lords inviſible pleaſure; ſhadowing their ſhapes in the drifts of his intentions? As for inſtance, when God was incenſed they brandiſhed ſwords; when he was appeaſed, they ſheathed them in ſcabbards; when he would defend, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled Souldiers; when he would terrifie, they took terrible forms; and when he would comfort, they carried mirth in their eyes, ſweetneſs in their countenance, mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their words, ſavour, and grace, and comelineſs in their preſence: why then doſt thou weep, ſeeing us to rejoyce? doſt thou imagine us to degenerate from our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to forget any duty, whoſe ſtate is neither ſubject to change, nor capable of the leaſt offence? art thou more fervent in thy love, or more privy to the counſel of our eternal God, than we that are daily attendants at his Throne of glory? <hi>O woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> Thus for Paraphraſe.</p>

Where a little of Chriſt is left, and that is loſt, it is a lamentable loſs. Mary</hi> had ſometimes a poſſeſſion of whole Chriſt, ſhe had his preſence, ſhe heard his words; ſhe ſaw his divinity in his miracles, and in caſting ſeven devils out of her own Body; but now ſhe had loſt all Chriſt, his preſence loſt, his preaching loſt, his divinity loſt, his humanity loſt, his ſoul loſt, and laſt of all his body loſt. O what lamentable loſs was this! <hi>Mary</hi> would now haven been glad of a little of Chriſt; O ye Angels, fill but her arms with the dead body of her Jeſus, and ſhe will weep no more; one beam of that Sun of righteouſneſs would ſcatter all the clouds of <hi>Mary's</hi> grief.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That ſomething ſhe ſpoke now to Chriſt which ſhe had not mentioned to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.

Jeſus muſt tell her what he had done with himſelf, ſure it was fitteſt for his own ſpeech to utter, what was only poſſible for his own power to do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the concluſion of her ſpeech was a meer vant or flouriſh, <hi>And I will take him away.</hi> Alas poor woman, ſhe was not able to lift him up, there are more than one or two allowed to the carrying of a corps; and as for his it had more than an hundred pound weight of myrrhe and other odours upon it; ſure ſhe had forgotten that women are weak, and that ſhe her ſelf was but a woman; how was it poſſible that ſhe ſhould <hi>take him away?</hi> ſhe could not do it; well, but ſhe would do it though; <hi>there is no eſſay too hard for love;</hi> ſhe exempts no place, ſhe eſteems no perſon, ſhe ſpeaks without fear, ſhe promiſes without condition, ſhe makes no exception, as if nothing were impoſſible that love ſuggeſteth; the darkneſs could not fright her from ſetting out before day, the watch could not fear her from coming to the Tomb where Chriſt was laid; ſhe reſolved to break open the ſeals, and to remove the ſtone, far above her ſtrength; and now her love being more incenſed with the freſh wound of her loſs, ſhe ſpeaks reſolutely, <hi>I will take him away,</hi> never conſidering whether ſhe could or no, love is not ruled with reaſon, but with love; it neither
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:94897:176"/> regards what can be, nor what ſhould be; but only what it ſelf deſireth to do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That through all this ſpeech ſhe omits the principal verb, ſhe enquires for Jeſus, but ſhe never names him whom ſhe enquires after. She could ſay to the Angels, <hi>they have taken away my Lord;</hi> but now ſhe talks of one under the term of him <hi>if thou haſt born him hence, tell me where thou haſt layd him, and I will take him away: him, him, him;</hi> but ſhe never names <hi>him,</hi> or tells who he is; this is <hi>ſolaeciſmus amoris,</hi> an irregular ſpeech, but loves one dialect; <hi>q.d.</hi> who knows not <hi>him?</hi> why, all the world is bound to take notice of <hi>him;</hi> he is worthy to be the owner of all thoughts; &amp; no thought in my conceit, can be well beſtowed upon any other than <hi>him.</hi> And therefore Sir Gardiner, whoſoever thou art, <hi>if thou haſt born him hence,</hi> thou knoweſt who I mean, thou canſt not be ignorant of whom I love; there is not ſuch another among the ſons of men; as the pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal 45.2.</note>

He ſpeaks unto her, <hi>Mary!</hi> it was but a word, but O what life? what Spirit? what quickening and reviving was in the word? the voice of Chriſt is powerful; <hi>if the Spirit of Chriſt come alone with the Word, it will rouſe hearts, raiſe ſpirits, work wonders.</hi> Ah poor <hi>Mary,</hi> what a caſe was ſhe in before Chriſt ſpeak unto her? ſhe ran up and down the Garden, with <hi>O my Lord, where have they layd my Lord?</hi> but no ſooner Chriſt comes, and ſpeaks to her by his Spirit, and with power, but her mind is enlightened, her heart is quickened, and her ſoul is revived. Obſerve here the difference betwixt the Word of the Lord, and the Lord ſpeaking that word with power and Spirit; we find ſometimes the hearts of Saints are quickened, fed, cheriſhed, healed, comforted in the uſe of the means; and ſometimes again they are dead, ſenſleſs, heavy, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened; nay, which is more, the very ſame truth which they hear at one time, it may be affects them, and at another time it doth not; the reaſon is, they hear but the Word of the Lord at one time, and they hear the Lord himſelf ſpeaking that word at another time; <hi>Mary</hi> heard the Word of the Lord by an Angel, <hi>woman, why weepest thou?</hi> but her tears dropped ſtill; ſhe heard again the word of the Lord by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> and yet ſhe weeps, and will not be comforted; but now Chriſt ſpeaks, and he ſpeaks with power, <hi>Mary!</hi> and at this word her tears are dried up, no more tears now, unleſs they be tears for joy; and yet again, obſerve the way how you may know and diſcern the effectual voice of Jeſus Chriſt; if it be effectual, it uſually ſingles a man out; yea, though it be generally ſpoken by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, yet the voice of Chriſt will ſpeak particularly to the very heart of a man, with a marvelous kind of Majeſty and Glory, ſtampt upon it, and ſhining in it, take an humble, broken, drooping Spirit, he hears of the free offer of grace and mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, but he refuſeth the offers; he hears of the precious promiſes of God in Chriſt, but he caſts by all promiſes, as things that are generally ſpoken and applyed by man; but when the Lord comes in, he ſpeaks particularly to his very heart, he meets with all his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that he thinks, <hi>this is the Lord, and this is to me.</hi> Thus <hi>Mary</hi> before heard the voice of an Angel, and the voice of Chriſt, <hi>woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> it was a general voice, no better title was then afforded, but <hi>woman;</hi> thou weepeſt like a woman; <hi>O woman,</hi> and too much a <hi>woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> but now Chriſt comes nearer, and he ſingles her out by her very name, <hi>Mary!</hi> Oh this voice came home, he ſhewed now that he was no ſtranger to her, he knew her by name: as ſomtimes God ſpake to <hi>Moſes, thou haſt found Grace in my ſight, I know thee by name;</hi> ſo Chriſt ſpeaks to <hi>Mary, thou haſt found grace in my ſight, I know thee by name.</hi>

Others think, that Chriſt in theſe words meant to wean her from all ſenſual touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to teach her a new and Spiritual touch by the hand of faith; and to this ſenſe the reaſon agrees well, <hi>for I am not yet aſcended,</hi> or, I ſhall quickly aſcend unto my Father; till Chriſt were aſcended ſhe might be touching with a ſenſual touch, but that would neither continue nor do her any good; but if ſhe would learn the Spiritual touch, no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending could hinder that; one that is in heaven might be touched ſo: and hence it is, that if now we will but ſend up our faith, we may touch Chriſt to this day, and there will vertue come out of him. It was Chriſt's care to wean <hi>Mary</hi> from the comfort of his external preſence, and to teach her how to embrace him by a true and lively faith: he was not long to be ſeen in his viſible ſhape, being ſhortly to aſcend unto his Father; and therefore the main buſineſs was to learn that touch, that would both continue and do her good to her ſouls health. And I believe for this very cauſe, Chriſt would not ſtay long with any of his Diſciples at any time; he only appeared to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf, and to prove his reſurrection, and then to wean t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some vilified the Miniſtry of <hi>Paul,</hi> below that of the reſt of the Apoſtles, becauſe he had not been converſant with Chriſt in the fleſh; to which <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers, away with this fleſhly knowledg, <hi>henceforth know we no man after the fleſh;</hi> our way to deal with Chriſt is in a Spiritual manner, yea the bleſſing is upon this manner, and not on that; <hi>bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Mary</hi> his mother, that ſhe had a double conception of Jeſus Chriſt, one in the womb of her body, another in the womb of her ſoul; the firſt indeed was more miraculous, the ſecond more benefical; that was a priviledg ſingular to her ſelf, but this was her happineſs common to all the choſen; it is the work of the inward man that God accepts; a Spiritual touch of Chriſt by faith is that which Chriſt prefers before all touches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>But go to my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God, and your God,</hi> this was the command of Chriſt; inſtead of touching him, ſhe muſt go with a meſſage to his Apoſtles, and this was more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial both to her and them. The firſt preacher of this reſurrection (beſides the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) was <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> ſhe that before had ſeven devils caſt out of her, had now the holy Spirit within her; ſhe that was but a woman, is now by Chriſt made an Apoſtle; <hi>Apoſtolorum Apoſtola,</hi> the Apoſtles, for to them ſhe was ſent, and the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſhe was to deliver, it was <hi>Chriſt's riſing and aſcending;</hi> and what were they but the Goſpel, yea the very Goſpel of the Goſpel? this was the firſt Sermon that ever was made by any mortals of Chriſt's reſurrection; and this her fact had ſome reference unto <hi>Eves</hi> fault; a woman was the firſt meſſenger of this our joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a woman was the firſt Miniſter of that our ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>But what means he to ſpeak of the aſcenſion, when as yet we are but upon the reſurrection? I ſuppoſe this was to prevent their miſtake, who might have thought, if Chriſt be riſen, why then we ſhall have his company again as heretofore; no ſaith Chriſt, I am not riſen to make any abode with you, or to converſe with
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:94897:178"/> you on earth as formerly; my riſing is in reference to my aſcending, look how the ſtars no ſooner riſe, but they are immediatly in their aſcendent: ſo Chriſt no ſooner riſen, but he is preſently upon his aſcending up.</p>
                  <p>But whither will he aſcend? <hi>to his Father, and our Father; to his God, and our God.</hi> Every word is a ſtep, or round of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder; by which we may aſcend up into heaven: As, 1. <hi>Father</hi> is a name of much good will: there is in it bowels of compaſſion. Oh what tenderneſs is in a Father? and yet many a Father wants good means to expreſs his good will unto his Child; now therefore God is added, that he may not be thought to be defective in that way; Oh Bleſſed meſſage! this is the voice of a Father to his Son: <hi>all that I have is thine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 15.31.</note> Now if this Father be alſo God, and if all that is God's to be alſo ours, what can we deſire more than all that God hath; or all that ever God was worth? Oh but here's the queſtion, whether his Father and God be alſo ours? that he is Chriſt s Father, and Chriſt's God, is without all queſtion; but that his Father ſhould be our Father, and that his God ſhould be our God, this were a Goſpel indeed; O then what a Goſpel is this, <hi>Go to my brethren, and ſay unto them, that our relations and intereſts are all but one; the ſame Father that is mine is theirs, and the ſame God that is mine is theirs;</hi> his relations are made ours, and our relations are made his interchangeably. No wonder if <hi>Luther</hi> tells us that the beſt divinity lay in pronouns; for as there is no comfort in heaven without God, and no comfort in God without a Father, ſo neither is there comfort in Father, Heaven, or God, without <hi>ours,</hi> to give us a property in them all.

But this <hi>I</hi> deliver, not as matter of Faith; reaſons are produced both wayes by the antient writers, and <hi>I</hi> refer you to them.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, why Chriſt retained theſe wounds and prints? many reaſons are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, though I ſhall not cloſe with all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some think thoſe skars or prints were as the trophies of his victory; nothing is more delightfull to a lover, than to bear about the wounds undergone for his beloved; and nothing is more honourable for a Souldier than to ſhew his wounds undergone for his countries good; what are they but as ſo many arguments of his valour, and trophies of his victory; this was <hi>Bedes</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Chriſt reſerved his skars,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Others think thoſe skars or prints were for the ſetting out of Chriſts ſplendor and beauty, as in cut or pinck garments the inward ſilks do appear more ſplended, ſo in Chriſt's wounds there appears inwardly far more beauty. <hi>Aquinas</hi> affirms, <hi>that in the very place of the wounds, there is a certain ſpecial comelineſs in Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinks,<note place="margin">Thom. <hi>3.</hi> part. q <hi>53.</hi> a cert.

Mark. 16.1.</note> ſaith <hi>Matthew, to Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary;</hi> or to three, ſaith <hi>Mark, to Mary Magdalen, Mary the mother of James,</hi> and <hi>Salome;</hi> but of this apparition he is ſeen of ten at leaſt; and to confirm their faith, not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable circumſtance muſt be wanting; here is time, and place, and perſons to whom he appears, and the manner how he appears, he ſtands in the midſt to be ſeen of all, he ſpeaks to them, breaths on them, eats with them, and ſhews them his hands, and his ſide; O the wonderful condeſcentions of Chriſt! what helps doth he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally afford to beget in us faith? if we are ignorant he inſtructs us, if we err, he reduceth us, if we ſin he corrrects us, if we ſtand he holds us up, if we fall down he lifts us up again, if we go he leads us, if we come to him he is ready to recieve us; there's not a paſſage of Chriſt betwixt him and his, but 'tis an argument of love, and a means either of begetting, or of increaſing Faith; O then believe in Chriſt, yea believe thy part in the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; conſidering that theſe apparitions were not only for the Apoſtles ſakes, but if Chriſt be thine, they were for thy ſake, that thou mighteſt believe, and be ſaved. But I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak more of this in the Chapter following. So much of the ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition as it is recorded by the Evangeliſt <hi>John.</hi>

                  <p>IMmediately after this apparition to his ten Apoſtles, the next is to all his Apoſtles, not one being abſent; and <hi>after eight days, again his Diſciples were within, and Thomas with them, then came Jeſus, the doors being ſhut and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid peace be unto you;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the whole ſtory we have Chriſt's apparition, and fruits of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Apparition (as in the former) we have, 1. The time. 2. The place. 3. The Perſons to whom he appeared. And, 4. The manner how he appeared.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the time, and after eight days; it was on the ſame day ſeven night after the former apparitions, which was the firſt day of the week, and now becauſe of his reſurrection,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> and apparitions, called the Lords day; <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,</hi> (this in my apprehenſion) makes much for the honour of the Lord's day: the firſt aſſembly of the Apoſtles, after Chriſt's death, was on the firſt day of the week; and the ſecond Church aſſembly that we read of, was again on the firſt day of the week, <hi>and after eight days;</hi> a ſign that the Lord's-day Sabbath was on the firſt day inſtituted, and that the more ſolemn aſſemblies of God<hi>'s</hi> people, were henceforth to be on the Lords days.<note place="margin">Aug. de verb.

                     </note> It is an uſual obſervation, that things <hi>and perſons which are named the Lords, are ſacred and venerable, in an high degree;</hi> as the grace of our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.24. the ſpirit of the Lord, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. the beloved of the Lord, <hi>Rom</hi> 16.8. the glory of the Lord, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. the word of the Lord, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. the cup of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us that <hi>the Lords reſurrection promiſed us an eternal day, &amp; that it conſecrated unto us the Lords day.</hi> Surely then this day muſt needs be venerable, &amp; a ſolemn day among us Chriſtians. Now it was that as the riſing of the Sun
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:94897:181"/> diſpelleth darkneſs, ſo Chriſt the Son of righteouſneſs ſhined forth unto the world by the light of his reſurrection; and hence we read of the Apoſtles obſervation of this very day above all others; <hi>The firſt day of the week, the Diſciples being come together to break bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them: — and concerning the collection for the Saints,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 20.7.</note> 
                     <hi>as I have given order to the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>even ſo do ye: upon the firſt day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God had proſpered him.</hi> Charitable contributions,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.1, 2.</note> and Church-aſſemblies were in uſe, and practiſe on the firſt day of the week, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> on the Lord's day. An argument ſufficient to me againſt all the oppoſers of this ſacred truth, that the firſt day of the week is our Chriſtian Sabboth; why then Chriſt aroſe, and at ſundry times appeared before his aſcention, and after his aſcention: Chriſt ſent down the holy Ghoſt on that very day; and after the ſending of the holy Ghoſt, the Apoſtles then preached, the Churches then aſſembled, Charities were then gathered, the Lord's Supper was then celebrated; Chriſt's firſt apparition was on that day, and after that day finiſhed, not any other apparition before this time: <hi>And after Eight days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the place, it is ſaid to be within; probably it was the ſame houſe wherein the former apparition was; the houſe wherein Chriſt celebrated the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and inſtituted the Lord's Supper; wherein was the <hi>large upper room made ready for Chriſt;</hi> In this upper room immediately after Chriſt's aſcenſion,<note place="margin">Mark 14.15.</note> was that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous aſſembly of all the Apoſtles; as we have heard. And in this upper room was that other famous aſſembly of all the twelve, when the holy Ghoſt came down upon them in cloven tongues of fire, at the feaſt of Pentecoſt; and if we may believe tradition;<note place="margin">Act. 2.1.</note> in this <hi>upper room</hi> the ſeven Deacons (whereof <hi>Stephen</hi> was one) were elected and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.

                     <note place="margin">Acts 6.</note> in this upper room the Apoſtles and Diſciples frequently aſſembled for prayer and ſupplications; <hi>Yea they continued there with one accord in prayer and ſupplication:</hi> And hence <hi>Cyril</hi> who was Biſhop of the place, calls it <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3.

Now Chriſt repeats the very ſelf-ſame words, and therein gives in one argument of his reſurrection; for if <hi>Chriſt</hi> could know what <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſaid, how is he but alive, and riſen from the dead? the dead have not ſenſe, much leſs the uſe of reaſon, but leaſt of all the knowledge of anothers mind; but Chriſt hath ſenſe and reaſon, ſcience and omniſcience; obſerve, <hi>Though Chriſt be abſent as in his bodily preſence, yet he underſtandeth all our thoughts, and if need were, he could repeat all our ſayings, word by word;</hi> How then may this convince all unbelievers in the world, that Chriſt is riſen, that he that was dead, now liveth, and that he is alive for ever more?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He appears arguing his Reſurrection from deeds, wherein is an act and object. 1. The act is, <hi>Thomas</hi> ſeeing and feeling, and <hi>q. d. Thomas, thou wilt not believe except thou ſeeſt,

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He acknowledgeth Chriſt to be his Lord, and his God; <hi>And Thomas anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaid unto him, my Lord, and my God.</hi> Now his ſaith broke out; from the things ſeen and felt; he is raiſed up to believe things neither ſeen nor felt; he ſees the prints and skars in the manhood of Chrſt, and now he believes that Chriſt is God, yea that Chriſt is his God; <hi>my Lord, and my God.</hi> Obſerve here, that <hi>faith gives the ſoul a propriety in God and Chriſt.</hi> As God loves ſome with a ſpecial and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar love, ſo faith anſwers God and Chriſt's particular love, by a particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>my Lord, and my God, and my Chriſt.</hi> Faith is an apropiating, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, an uniting grace; in the actings of faith on God, or on Chriſt as God, we may obſerve theſe ſteps,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſees God in his Glory and Majeſty, in his Greatneſs and Goodneſs, and all other his attributes; it ſees God as the infinite fountain of all good, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what an infinite dreadful thing it were to be ſeparated from this God; it ſees God, and the ſight makes a deep impreſſion on that very ſoul; the love of that God is more to the ſoul than all the world; and the leaſt diſpleaſure of that God is more trouble to that ſoul, than all the miſeries that all creatures under heaven are able to bring upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It diſcovers the reality of this Glory and Majeſty, of this greatneſs and goodneſs of God. Before any faith is planted in a ſoul, the very uſe of reaſon may come to underſtand much of God and Chriſt, but in compariſon it looks upon God and Chriſt as notions, conceits, and imaginary things; only faith convinces the ſoul throughly of the certainty and truth of ſuch things; where true faith is, the things we believe are more certain to us than things we ſee, or feel, or handle; faith is ſo ſure in its apprehenſions of God and Chriſt, that it will venture ſoul and body, the loſs of all upon that account; it will bear any hardſhip, yea it will venture the infinite loſs of eternity upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It enables the ſoul to caſt it ſelf upon God in Chriſt for all the good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs it ever expects. Alas, ſaith the ſoul, I have formerly reſted on worldly things, I looked upon them as the only, real, ſure excellences that I had to enjoy; but now I find they are vain things, deceitful things, no better than reeds of <hi>Egypt,</hi> vanity of vanities; and nothing is real, ſure, excellent on this ſide God and Chriſt,<note place="margin">Cant. 6.2.</note> and therefore <hi>I</hi> will rely upon him, and none but him; it is only <hi>God</hi> is an all-ſufficient good, it is only Chriſt that is the rock that will never fail, on him will <hi>I</hi> role my ſelf, unto him will <hi>I</hi> make an abſolute reſignation of all, <hi>I</hi> will betruſt him with all I have, and all <hi>I</hi> am; <hi>I</hi> will commit all unto him for ever, and ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As faith relyes all upon God in Chriſt, ſo it apropriates all God, and all Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf, <hi>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine;</hi> there is a mutual propriety betwixt Chriſt and the Church, and betwixt Chriſt and the ſoul; Chriſt hath a propriety in me,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.35.</note> and <hi>I</hi> have a peculiar propriety in Chriſt, Chriſt is mine, ſo as <hi>I</hi> have none in the world ſo mine, <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee,</hi>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:94897:184"/> Chriſt is mine, and mine in a peculiar manner, there is a propriety with peculiarity, <hi>my Lord, and my God.</hi> O the excellency of Faith! this ſtep goes beyond all the reſt; it is a bleſſed thing to have a true ſight of God, there is much Power in it; but to ſee God in his glory, Majeſty, greatneſs, goodneſs, as my God; to ſee all the att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ibutes of God as thoſe things that my ſoul hath an intereſt in; to ſee Chriſt coming from the Father for me, to be my redeemer; to ſee Chriſt in whom all fulneſs dwells, (in whom the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of all God's riches are, not only Chriſt dying as man, but riſing as God for me, and my ſalvation;<note place="margin">John 20.29</note> to ſee Chriſt, and then to lay hold on Chriſt, and to ſay, <hi>my Lord, and my God.</hi> O this is the work of precious ſaith; and to this now is <hi>Thomas</hi> arrived in this confeſſion of his, <hi>my Lord and my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereupon follows Chriſt's commendation and correction; Jeſus ſaith unto him, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt believed; bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed;</hi> In the firſt place Chriſt commends <hi>Thomas's</hi> ſaith, <hi>becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt believed,</hi> q. d. thou ſeeſt me a man; but conſidering how I am riſen from the dead, thou believeſt in me as God; I commend thy faith, but 'tis a weak faith in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its riſe; now therefore to correct it, I pronounce thoſe bleſſed to all generations, that when I am gone, as in regard of my bodily preſence, yet they will believe in me; <hi>bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi> I am afraid of tediouſneſs, and therefore I ſhall not enlarge any more on this apparition.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The Perſons to whom he appears, they were <hi>Diſciples,</hi> their names are in the next verſe. All Chriſt's apparitions were to the Diſciples of Chriſt; we read not that ever he ſhewed himſelf after his reſurrection to any but to his followers; he ſhewed himſelf openly, <hi>not to all the people, but unto witneſſes, choſen before of God, even to us who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead, Act.</hi> 10.41.<note place="margin">Acts 10.41.</note> ſtrangers to Chriſt muſt be no witneſſes of Chriſt's reſurrection, and this was his meaning; <hi>yet a little while, and the world ſeeth me no more, but ye ſee me,</hi> Joh. 14.19.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the manner of his apparition, <hi>on this wiſe ſhewed he himſelf.</hi>

Chriſt now was not ſeen, or known to the bodily eye (for his body was immortal) unleſs by diſpenſation he condeſcended thereto.</hi> I deny not, but that glorified bodies are ever actually ſeen of bodies that are glorified; but of mortal men who are yet in this vail of tears thoſe glorious creatures cannot be ſeen actually, except there be ſome peculiar and divine diſpenſation. As the ayre is too ſubtile to be ſeen, or as the Sun is too glorious for a weak eye to behold; ſo are glorified bodyes too ſubtile, too ſolendid for a mortal eye to pierce:<note place="margin">Mat. 1.43.

                  <p n="1">1. Let us <hi>know Jeſus</hi> carrying on the great work of our ſalvation for us in his reſurrection; and during the time of his abode upon earth after his Reſurrection. This is worth the knowing; on it depends our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſanctification, ſalvation; <hi>For if Chriſt be not riſen, we are yet in our ſins, and our faith is in vain, and our hope is in vain;</hi> little hope have we either of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or of Reſurrection, if Chriſt be not riſen; of all men we are moſt miſerable that believe in Chriſt, if he whom we believe in be not riſen again. O my ſoul ſtudy this point; many take it up in groſs, they can run over this Article of their Creed, <hi>The third day he roſe again from the dead;</hi> but for a particular underſtanding of it, in reſpect of the time, or the end, or the manner, or the certainty, how many are to ſeek? I ſhall appeal to thy ſelf, are not many diſcoveries already made which before thou never tookeſt notice of? and if thou wouldſt but ſtudy this point, how much more might yet appear? eſpecially, how much more might yet appear as to thine own good? it is not enough to know Chriſt's reſurrection, unleſs thou know it for thy ſelf. Be ſure thou haſt this in mind, <hi>That Chriſt roſe again, but what's that to me?</hi> ſaving knowledge is ever joyned with a particular application; if Chriſt be my Head, then he could not riſe, but I roſe with him, and in him: and thus O my ſoul, <hi>look on Chriſt;</hi> and thus ſearch into every particular of Chriſt's reſurrection; come,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:94897:185"/> ſtudy when he roſe; ſtudy the Arguments that make out Chriſt's reſurrection ſure and certain; ſtudy all the Apparitions of Jeſus Chriſt; O what delightful ſtudies are theſe? hadſt thou been with them to whom Chriſt appeared, would not thy heart have leaped with joy? come, ſtudy it cloſe, for the benefit of theſe Apparitions extend to thee; the fruit of Chriſt's reſurrection is thine,<note place="margin">Job 5.27.</note> even thine, as well as theirs; <hi>Know this for thy ſelf.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. LEt us <hi>conſider Jeſus,</hi> carrying on this work of our ſalvation for us in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. It is not enough to know a ſaving neceſſary truth, but it is required further that we digeſt truths, and that we draw forth their ſtrength for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and refreſhing of our poor ſouls. As a man may in half an hour chew and take into his ſtomack that meat, which he muſt have ſeven or eight hours at leaſt to digeſt; ſo a man may take into his underſtanding more truths in an hour, than he is able well to digeſt in many; what good thoſe men are like to get by Sermon's or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, who are unaccuſtomed to this work of meditation, I cannot imagine; it is obſerved by ſome, that this is the reaſon why ſo much preaching is loſt amongſt us; why Profeſſors that run from Sermon to Sermon, and are never weary of hearing or reading, have notwithſtanding ſuch languiſh ſtarved ſouls, becauſe they will not meditate. And therefore God commanded, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> not only to read the Law, but to conſider of it,<note place="margin">Joſh. 1.8.</note> and dwell upon it; <hi>This Book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night;</hi> why, this is the <hi>duty</hi> that I am now preſſing to; if thou knoweſt theſe things, conſider, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uminate, meditate, ponder on them again, and again. And becauſe this work requires enlargedneſs of heart and ſpirit, therefore take it into parts, and conſider of each of them apart by it ſelf. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider of the time when Chriſt roſe again. As Chriſt had his three dayes, and no more, ſo muſt thou have the ſame three dayes like unto his; the firſt day was called the day of preparation; the ſecond was the Sabbath-day; and the third was the reſurrection day; ſo thy firſt day is a day of preparation, a day of paſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou muſt ſtrive and ſtruggle againſt ſin, and Satan, wherein thou muſt ſuffer all their bitter darts till thou dyeſt, and give up the Ghoſt. And thy ſecond day is a day of reſt, wherein thy body muſt lye in the grave, and thy fleſh reſt in hope; wherein thou ſhalt <hi>enter into peace, and reſt in thy bed,</hi> until the trumpet ſound, and bid thee <hi>ariſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 52.7.</note> 
                     <hi>and come to judgment:</hi> And thy third day is a day of reſurrection unto glory. It is the firſt day of the week, or the firſt beginning of a never ending world. Thus conſider the time of Chriſt's reſurrection, and thence mayſt thou draw down ſome uſe for thy ſouls nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider of the reaſons why Chriſt aroſe; was it not to confound the Jews? they could not endure to hear of Chriſt's reſurrection, and therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles preached that point,<note place="margin">Acts 9.33.</note> 
                     <hi>They were cut to the heart, and took councel to ſlay them.</hi> It is the caſe of them to ſay, <hi>We will not have that man to reign over us;</hi> they that by their ſins crucifie Chriſt every day, cannot without horror think of his exaltation, it cuts them to the heart that Chriſt is riſen to be their Judge. Again, was it not to confirm the faith of Chriſt's followers? till he was riſen, their faith was but a weak faith; weak in knowledge, weak in aſſent, weak in confidence, weak in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; much ado had Chriſt with them, many a time had he chid them, <hi>Why are ye fearful O ye of little faith?</hi> but after he had ſhewed uimſelf alive by many infallible proofs, they could then cry it out, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> Again, was it not to evidence that he had fully ſatisfied all our debts? the Apoſtle tells us, that Chriſt was our <hi>Surety;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.22.</note> at his death he was arreſted, and caſt into Priſon, whence he could not come till all was payed: and therefore to hear that Chriſt is riſen, and that he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the bolts and fetters of the grave, it is a clear evidence that God is ſatisfied, and that Chriſt is diſcharged by God himſelf. Oh what breaſts of conſolation are here? Again, was it not to conquer ſin, death, and devil? now he took from death his ſting, and from hell his ſtandard; now he ſeized upon the hand-writing that was againſt
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:94897:185"/> us, and nailed to his croſs, now he ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and carried the keys of death and hell, at his own girdle; now he came out of the grave as a mighty Conqueror, ſaying as <hi>Dehorah</hi> did in her ſong, <hi>O my ſoul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 5.21.</note> 
                     <hi>thou haſt trodden down ſtrength, thou haſt marched valiantly.</hi> Again, was it not to become the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep? Chriſt was the firſt that roſe again from the grave to dye no more; and by vertue of his reſurrection (as being the firſt-fruits) all the Elect muſt riſe again; <hi>As in Adam all dye, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.22, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>but every man in his own order, Chriſt the firſt-fruits, and afterwards they that are Chriſt's at his coming.</hi> Some may wonder, can the reſurrection of one, a thouſand ſix hundred years ago, be the cauſe of our riſing? yes, as well as the death of one, five thouſand ſix hundred years ago, is the cauſe of our dying; <hi>Adam,</hi> and Chriſt were two heads, two roots, two firſt-fruits, either of them in reference to his company whom they ſtand for. And now O my ſoul, thou mayſt ſay with <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 19.25.</note> 
                     <hi>and that I ſhall ſee him at the laſt day, not with other, but with theſe ſame eyes.</hi> If Chriſt live, then muſt I live alſo; if he be riſen, then <hi>though after my skin worms ſhall destroy this body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God.</hi> Again, was it not that he might be declared to be the Son of God? was it not that he might be exalted, and glorified? this is the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all the reſt; ſee thou to this! O give him the glory, and praiſe of his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo muſe, and meditate, and conſider on this tranſaction, as to aſcribe to his Name all honour, and glory; what, is he riſen from the dead? <hi>Hath God highly exalted him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.11.</note> 
                     <hi>and given him a name above every name?</hi> O then let <hi>every tongue confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider of the manner of Chriſt's reſurrection; he roſe as a common perſon; in which reſpect his reſurrection concerns us no leſs than himſelf. We muſt not think that when Chriſt was raiſed, it was no more than when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raiſed; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was the reſurrection of us all; it was in the name of us all, and had in it a ſeed-like vertue to work the reſurrection of us all. O the priviledge of this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt's reſurrection! if I believe this truly, I cannot but believe <hi>the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of my body, and the life everlaſting;</hi> why, Jeſus Chriſt hath led the dance, and though of my ſelf I have no right to Heaven or Glory, yet in Chriſt my Head I have as good right to it as any heir apparent to his lands.—2. He roſe by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and ſo did none but Jeſus Chriſt; from the beginning of the world it was never heard that any dead man raiſed himſelf; Indeed one Inſtance we have that a dead mans Corps ſhould raiſe up another dead man, <hi>They caſt the man into the Sepulchre of Eliſha,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 King 13.21.</note> 
                     <hi>and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Eliſha, he revived and ſtood up on his feet;</hi> dead <hi>Eliſha</hi> raiſed up a dead man from the grave, but dead <hi>Eliſha</hi> could not raiſe up himſelf from the grave; only Chriſt aroſe himſelf, and at the ſame time he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many others; and here was the argument of his God-head,<note place="margin">John 10.18.</note> 
                     <hi>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again;</hi> how ſhould we but truſt him with our life, who is the reſurrection and the life? <hi>He that believeth in him though he were dead, yet ſhall he live.</hi> O my ſoul, he was able to raiſe himſelf, much more is he able to raiſe thee up; only believe, and live for ever.—3. He roſe with an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake; O the power of Chriſt in every paſſage! what ayled thee O earth to skip like a Ram? was not the new Tomb hewn out of a Rock? and was not a great ſtone rolled to the door of the Sepulchre? the ground wherein he lay was firm and ſolid,<note place="margin">Job 18.4. Pſal. 99.1.</note> and <hi>ſhall the rock be removed out of his place?</hi> O yes; <hi>the Lord reigneth, and therefore the earth is moved;</hi> Oh what a rocky heart is this of mine? how much harder is it than that rock; that moves not, melts not at the preſence of God, at the preſence of the God of <hi>Jacob?</hi> the Sun (they ſay) danced that morning at Chriſt's reſurrection; the earth (I am ſure) then trembled; and yet my heart is no way affected with this news; I feel it neither dance for joy, nor tremble for fear; O my ſoul be ſerious in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, conſider, what a poſture wouldſt thou have been in, if thou hadſt been with thoſe Souldiers that watched Chriſt; ſo reallize this Earthquake, as if thou now felt it trembling under thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. An Angel miniſtred to him at his reſurrection; <hi>An Angel came,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 28.2.</note> 
                     <hi>and rolled back the ſtone from the door, and ſate upon it.</hi> Angels were the firſt Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the firſt Preachers of Chriſt's reſurrection; they preached more of Chriſt than all the Prophets did; they firſt told the woman that <hi>Chriſt was riſen;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.6.</note> and they did the firſt ſervice to Chriſt at his reſurrection, <hi>in rolling the ſtone from the doors mouth;</hi> O my ſoul, that thou wert but like theſe bleſſed Angels! how is it that they are ſo
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:94897:186"/> forward in <hi>God</hi>'s Service, and thou art ſo backward? One day thou expecteſt to be equal with the Angels, and art thou now ſo far behind them? What! to be equal in Reward, and behind them in Service? Here's a Meditation able to check thy Sloath, and to ſpur thee on to thy Duty. — 5. Many of the Bodies of the Saints aroſe out of their Graves at His Reſurrection; as the Angels miniſtred, ſo the Saints waited on Him. In this Meditation, trouble not thy ſelf whether <hi>David, Moſes, Job, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were ſome of thoſe Saints, as ſome conjecture upon ſome Grounds: It is a better Conſideration to look upon them as the Fruit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection, and as an Earneſt of thy Own: The Vertue of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection appears immediately, and it will more appear at the general Reſurrection Day. As ſure as theſe Saints aroſe with Him, and went into the Holy City, and appeared unto many; ſo ſure ſhall thy Body riſe again at the Laſt Day; and (if thou art but a Saint) it ſhall go with Him into the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and appear before <hi>God,</hi> and His Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. —6. <hi>Chriſt</hi> roſe again with a true and perfect Body, with an Incorruptible and Powerful Body, with a Spiritual and an Agile Body, with a Glorious Body, brighter than the <hi>Sun</hi> in his utmoſt Glory. On theſe things may the Soul expatiate: O it is a worthy, bleſſed, ſoul-raviſhing Subject to think upon; and the rather, if we conſider that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity which we believe:<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>We look for a Saviour</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who ſhall change our vile Bodies, that they may be faſhioned unto His Glorious Body.</hi> O my Soul, that this Clay of thine ſhould be a Partaker of ſuch Glory! That this Body of Duſt and Earth ſhould ſhine in Heaven like thoſe Glorious Spangles of the Firmament; that this Body that ſhall rot in Duſt, and fall more vile than a Carrion, ſhould riſe, and ſhine like the Glorious Body of our Saviour on Mount <hi>Tabor:</hi> Surely thou oweſt much to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection. O conſider of it, till thou feelleſt the Influence, and comeſt to the Aſſurance of this Bleſſed Change.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider of the ſeveral Apparitions of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> eſpecially of thoſe written by the Evangeliſt <hi>John.</hi> As,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Muſe on His Apparition to <hi>Mary Magdalen:</hi> Oh the Grief before He appeared! And, Oh the Joyes when He appeared!— 1. Before, ſhe apprehended nothing, but that ſome or other had took away her <hi>Lord;</hi> theſe were all the words ſhe uttered before he appeared; <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him;</hi> ſo ſhe told <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John:</hi> And when Two Angels appeared in White, asking her; <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Why weepeſt thou?</hi> ſhe gives the ſame Anſwer to them; <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.</hi> A Soul in deſertion knows not what to do, but to weep and cry; <hi>Oh my Lord is gone! I have loſt my Lord, my</hi> God, <hi>my</hi> Jeſus, <hi>my King!</hi> In this Meditation, conſider, O my Soul, as if thou hadſt been in <hi>Maries</hi> Caſe: Was it not a ſad Caſe, when the Angels of Heaven knew not how to comfort her? Suppoſe any Son of Conſolation had ſtood by, and had ſuch a one perſwaded; <hi>O Mary, ſuppreſs thy Sadneſs, refreſh thy Heart with this Bleſſed Viſion; thou didſt ſeek but One, and thou haſt found Two; a dead Body was thy Errand, and thou haſt light on Two alive: Thy Weeping was for a Man, and thy Tears have obtained Angels: Obſerve them narrowly; the Angels invite thee to a Parley, it may be they had ſome happy News to tell thee of thy</hi> Lord: <hi>Remember what they are, and where they ſit, and whence they come, and to whom they ſpeak; they are Angels of Peace; neither ſent without Cauſe, nor ſeen but of Favour; they ſit on the Tomb, to ſhew they are no Strangers to thy Loſs: They come from Heaven, from whence all happy News deſcendeth; they ſpeak to thy ſelf, as if they had ſome ſpecial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage to deliver unto thee.</hi> No, no; theſe Cordials are in vain; neither Man nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel can do her good, or comfort her drooping Soul: Either <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf muſt come in Preſence, or ſhe cryes; <hi>Miſerable Comforters are ye all! Alas! ſmall is the Light that a Star can yield, when the</hi> Sun <hi>is down: A ſorry Exchange it is, to go &amp; gather Crumbs, after the Loſs of the Bread of Life. Oh, What can theſe Angels do? They cannot perſwade me that my Maſter is not loſt; for my own Eyes will diſprove them: They can leſs tell me where He may be found; for they themſelves would wait upon Him, if they knew but where: I am apt to think, they know not where He is; and therefore they are come to the Place where He laſt was, making the Tomb their Heaven, and the Remembrance of His Preſence the Fewel of their Joy: Alas! What do Angels here? I neither came to ſee them, nor deſire to hear them: I came not to ſee Angels, but the Creator of Angels, to whom I owe more than both to Men and Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. After He appeared, ſhe was filled with Joy; for ſo it was, that when nothing elſe would ſatisfie, or comfort this poor Creature, <hi>Jeſus</hi> Himſelf appears: At firſt He is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:94897:186"/> ſhe takes him for the Gardiner of the place, but within a while he utters a voice that opens both her ears, and eyes; <hi>And Jeſus ſaith unto her, Mary.</hi> It was the ſweeteſt ſound that ever ſhe heard; many a time had ſhe been called by that name, but never heard ſhe a voice ſo effectual, powerful, inward, feeling as at this time; hereby the cloud is ſcattered, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs appears; this one word <hi>Mary,</hi> lightens her eyes, dryes up her tears, chears her heart, revives her ſpirits that were as good as dead. One word of Chriſt wrought ſo ſtrange an alteration in her, as if ſhe had been wholly made new, when ſhe was only named. And hence it is that being raviſhed with his voice, and impatient of delayes, ſhe takes his talk out of his mouth, and to his firſt and only word <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe anſwers, <hi>Rabboni] which is to ſay, Maſter,</hi> q. d. <hi>Maſter, is it thou? with many a ſalt tear have I ſought thee, and art thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly ſo near at hand! thy abſence was hell, and thy preſence is no leſs than heaven to me: Oh how is my heart raviſhed at thy ſound? if the babe leaped in the womb of Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth when ſhe but heard the ſalutation of Mary, how ſhould my heart but leap at thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation? I feel I am exceedingly tranſported beyond my ſelf. Inſtead of my heavy heart and troubled ſpirit, I feel now a ſweet and delightful Tranquility of mind; thou art my ſolace, and ſouls delight; whom have I in heaven but thee? and whom deſire I upon earth in compariſon of thee? and yet I am not ſatisfied; not only fruition of thee, but union with thee is that which my ſoul longs after; not only thy preſence, but thy embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or my embraces of thee can give content; come then, and give me leave, my Lord, my God, to run to the haunt of my chief delights, to fall at thy ſacred feet, and to bathe them with my tears of joy; O my Jeſus I muſt needs deal with thee, as the Spouſe dealt with thee: Now I have found thee whom my ſoul loves dearly, I will hold thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and I will not let thee go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not in all the Book of God a ſoul more depreſſed with ſorrow, and lifted up with joy: O meditate on this! if Chriſt be abſent, all is night; but if Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, he turns all again into a lightſome day; there is no ſorrow like that which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Chriſt's loſs, and therefore in hell it is looked upon as the greateſt pain; of the two (ſay Divines) it is a greater torment to loſe God, and to loſe Jeſus Chriſt, than to endure all thoſe flaming whips, unquenchable fires, intollerable cold, abominable ſtench; and on the other ſide, there is no joy in heaven like to that which apprehends Chriſt's preſence: <hi>In thy preſence there is fulneſs of joy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11.</note> 
                     <hi>and at thy right hand there are pleaſures evermore. I had rather be in hell with Chriſt</hi> (ſaid one) <hi>than in heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt.</hi> This is the very top of heavens joy, the quinteſſence of glory, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs of the Saints; O my ſoul, ſeek with <hi>Mary,</hi> yea ſeek and weep, and weep and ſeek, and never reſt ſatisfied till Chriſt appear. If thou art but in the uſe of means, he will appear ſooner or later; or what if thou never ſaweſt a good day on earth, one ſight of Chriſt in heaven will make amends. Surely if thou kneweſt the joy of Chriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, thou wouldſt run through death and hell to come to Chriſt: it was <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt which is far better;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> he cared not for death ſo he might go to Chriſt, for that was better than very life it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Muſe on his Apparition to the Ten Diſciples,<note place="margin">John 20.19.</note>

Here's a ſtrong Argument to convince my ſoul that Chriſt is riſen from the dead; why, ſee; this is the ſame Chriſt that was crucified; the ſame Chriſt that had his hands boared with nails, and that had his heart pierced with a ſpear; though the wounds are healed as to ſenſe of pain, yet the skars, and holes, and clefts remain as big as ever: the hole in his hand is yet ſo large, that <hi>Thomas</hi> may put his finger not only on it, but into it; and the cleft in his ſide is yet ſo large, that <hi>Thomas</hi> may thruſt his whole hand into his ſide, and with his fingers touch that heart that iſſued out ſtreams of blood for my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. In this meditation be not too curious, whether the print of the nails were but continued till Chriſt had confirmed his Diſciples faith; or whether he retains them ſtill for ſome further uſe? it is a better conſideration to look upon them ſo as to confirm thy own faith; is there not too much of <hi>Thomas</hi>'s incredulity in thy breaſt? doſt not thou ſometimes feel ſome doubtings of Chriſt's riſing? or at leaſt doſt thou not queſtion whether Chriſt's reſurrection belongs unto thee? is not Satan buſie with a temptation? is not thy conſcience troubled for thy ſins; and eſpecially for thy ſin of unbelief? if ſo, (and I know not but it may be ſo with thee, and the beſt of Saints) <hi>Come then,</hi> and <hi>reach hither thy finger, and behold Chriſt's hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into his ſide;</hi> my meaning is, come with the hand of faith, and lay hold on Chriſt, yea hide thy ſelf in the holes of the rock; <hi>Be like the Dove that maketh her neſt in the ſide of the holes mouth;</hi>

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:94897:188"/> his death is for the applying of our juſtification, as the ſtamp adds no vertue, nor matter of real value to a piece of gold; but only it makes that value which before it had actually appliable and currant unto us: ſo the reſurrection of Chriſt was no part of the price or ſatisfaction which Chriſt made to God, yet is it that which applies all his merits, and makes them of force unto his Members.

                  <p>LEt us <hi>hope in Jeſus,</hi> as carrying on the great work of our ſalvation for us in his reſurrection. Only remember, I mean not a fluctuating, wavering, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled, uneſtabliſhed <hi>hope;</hi> no, no, let us hope firmly, ſurely, fixedly; let us come up to that plerophory, or <hi>full aſſurance of hope;</hi> that we may conclude comfortably, and confidently, <hi>Chriſts reſurrection is ours;</hi> and yet that our concluſion may not be raſh, but upon right grounds, we may examine the firmneſs, ſolidneſs, ſubſtantialneſs of our hope in Chriſts reſurrection by theſe following ſigns.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If Chriſts reſurrection be mine, then is Chriſts death mine; the fruits or effects of Chriſts death and reſurrection cannot be ſevered; <hi>if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note> 
                     <hi>we ſhall be in the likeneſs of his reſurrection.</hi> Mortification, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification, are twins of one and the ſame ſpirit; <hi>depart from evil and do good.— Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well.</hi> Many may think they have their part in the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.14. Iſa. 1.16, 17.</note> but can they prove their death unto ſin? as there cannot be a reſurrection before a man dye, ſo there cannot be a reſurrection to a new life, but there muſt be a ſeparation of the ſoul from the body of ſin; what, ſhall a man cleave to ſin, be wedded to ſin; yea ſhall a man like it, love it, live in it, and yet ſay or imagine that Chriſts reſurrection is his? O be not deceived, God is not mocked! come, ſcearch, try, examine, haſt thou any ſhare in Chriſts paſſion? knoweſt thou the fellowſhip of his ſufferings? art thou made conformable to his death, that as he dyed for ſin; ſo thou dyeſt to ſin? if herein thou art at a ſtand, peruſe thoſe Characters laid down in his ſufferings and death, the truth and growth of our mortification, or of our death unto ſin is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Chriſts reſurrection be mine, then is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Spirit mine, yea then am <hi>I</hi> quickened by the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.9, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his:—but if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, then he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodyes</hi> (and I may add your
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:94897:189"/> mortal ſouls) <hi>by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> Chriſts Spirit (if Chriſts reſurrection be ours) will have the ſame operation and effect in our ſouls that it had in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as it raiſed up the one, ſo it will raiſe up the other; as it quickened the one, ſo it will quicken the other. But the queſtion here will run on, how ſhall we know whether we have received this quickning Spirit? many pretend to the Spirit never more than at this day, but how may we be aſſured that the Spirit is ours? I anſwer.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Spirit is a Spirit of illumination; here is the beginning of his work, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in light; as in the firſt creation, the firſt-born of God's works, was light,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>God ſaid, let there be light, and there was light;</hi> ſo in this new creation, the firſt work is light, God <hi>who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs hath ſhined into our hearts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> 
                     <hi>to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence the ſtate of nature is called <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and the ſtate of grace is called <hi>light; Ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now ye have light in the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5.8. 1 Pet. 2.9.</note> And <hi>he hath called you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> There is a light in the mind, and a light in the heart, of thoſe who have the Spirit of Chriſt; there is a ſpeculative and an affective knowledg, not only to know the truth, but to love it, believe it, embrace it. O my ſoul, wouldſt thou know whether Chriſts Spirit be thine? conſider, and ſee then whether any of this new light of Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhined into thy heart; take heed, deceive not thy ſelf, thou mayeſt have a great deal of wit, and knowledg, and underſtanding, and yet go to hell; this light is a light ſhining into thy heart, this light is a Chriſt-diſcovering light; this light is a ſin-diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings light; this light will cauſe thee to find out thy hypocriſy, deadneſs, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſpiritual duties; if thou haſt not this light thou art near to eternal burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; darkneſs is one of the properties of hell, and without this light, inward darkneſs will to utter darkneſs, where is nothing but <hi>weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This quickening ſpirit, is a ſpirit of faith; as it reveals Chriſt, ſo it inclines mens hearts to cloſe with Chriſt upon thoſe Goſpel-terms, as he is offered. I know there are degrees and meaſures of faith, but the leaſt meaſure of faith is a deſiring, panting, breathing after the Lord Jeſus; and no ſooner hath the ſoul received that new light from the ſpirit of Chriſt, but it is preſently, at the ſame inſtant, exceedingly affected with Jeſus Chriſt; O it deſires Chriſt above all deſires. I know not a more undeceiving ſign than this; read over the whole Bible, and where ever there was any ſoul-ſaving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, there ever followed inward deſires, ſoul-longings after Jeſus Chriſt; when <hi>Paul</hi> preached of the reſurrection of Chriſt, ſome there were that mocked, jeered, and ſlighted that doctrine, but others (whoſe heart the Lord ſtirred) they were exceedingly taken with it ſaying <hi>we will hear thee again of this matter;</hi> yea, &amp; this very Sermon ſo wrought on ſome that <hi>they believed, among whom was Dyonyſius the Areopagite, &amp; a woman named Damaris, and others with them;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 17.32, 34.</note> and when he preaced another Sermon on the ſame ſubject at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were much offended, but the Gentiles were ſo exceedingly taken with it that <hi>they beſought Paul, that theſe words</hi> (the very ſame reſurrection Sermon) <hi>might be preached to them the next Sabbath day.</hi> Their very hearts did ſo long after Chriſt whom <hi>Paul</hi> had preached, that <hi>when the congregation was broken up,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13.42,</note> 
                     <hi>many of the</hi> Jews <hi>and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Procelites followed Paul and Barnabas; and the next Sabbath day came almoſt the whole City together to hear the ſame Sermon.</hi> O my ſoul,<note place="margin">43.</note> doſt thou hear theſe Sermons of Chriſts reſurrection; doſt thou hear ſweet-Goſpel-preaching?<note place="margin">44.</note> doſt thou hear the free tenders and offers of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> with all his glory and excellency to poor ſinners, to vile, loſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done ſouls, and art thou no whit taken with them? canſt thou ſleep away ſuch Sermons as theſe? haſt thou no heart-riſings, no ſtirrings, workings, longings, deſires in thy ſoul? O take heed! this is a dangerous caſe: but on the contrary, if thou ſayeſt in thy heart, <hi>Oh that I could hear this Sermon again! O the ſweet vertues of Chriſts reſurrection! I had not thought ſuch honey could have dropped out of this rock; O the bleſſed beginnings and ſpringings of grace which I felt in my ſoul on ſuch a meditation! Oh the deſire, the delight! O the longings! O the comforts of Chriſts reſurrection! O the drawings of the Spirit, inclining my heart to receive Jeſus Chriſt, to cloſe with him, and to reſt on him, and to give up my ſelf to him!</hi> why this Spirit of faith doth argue thy title and intereſt to the quickening ſpirit <hi>of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thy quickening Spirit, is a Spirit of ſanctification; ſuch was the Spirit, whereby Chriſt was raiſed, <hi>he was declared mightily to be the Son of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> 
                     <hi>according to the Spirit of ſanctification, by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> That ſame Spirit which raiſed up
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:94897:190"/> Jeſus Chriſt, was that ſame divine Spirit which ſanctified his humane nature wherein it dwelt; and ſuch is that quickening Spirit to all in whom it dwelleth; it is a Spirit of holineſs, and it works holineſs, changing the heart, and turning the bent of it from ſin to holineſs.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man be in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>he is a new creature; old things are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away, behold all things are become new.</hi> q. d. When once the believer is by an act of faith paſſed over unto Chriſt, there goes immediately from the Spirit of Chriſt into his ſoul an effectual power, which alters and changes the frame of the whole man; now he is not the ſame that he was; he is changed in his company, in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in his practiſe; he is changed in his nature, judgment, will, affections; he is <hi>ſanctified throughout in ſoul, body, and Spirit;</hi> O my ſoul, try thy ſelf by this ſign, doſt thou find ſuch an inward change wrought in the ſoul? doſt thou find the law of God, a law of holineſs written on thy hearr? doſt thou find a law within thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law of ſin, commanding with authority that which is holy and good? ſo that thou canſt ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I delight in the law of God after the inward man?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23, 25. Rom. 8.1.</note> and <hi>with my mind I my ſelf ſerve the law of</hi> God? if ſo, ſurely this is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>but the law of the ſpirit of life in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> or the law of this quickening Spirit, communicated from Chriſt, unto thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Chriſt's reſurrection be mine, then am I <hi>planted together in the likneſs of Chriſt's reſurrection;</hi> then do I reſemble, and am made conformable to Chriſt in his reſurrection; now if we would know wherein that reſemblance is, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that like as Chriſt was riſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father,</hi>

                     <hi>even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> Our mortification is a reſemblance of Chriſt's death, and our vivification is a reſemblance of Chriſts reſurrection.

                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note>1. Whether indeed and in truth our ſouls are vivified?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether we increaſe and grow in our vivification?</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, the truth and certainty of our vivification will appear by theſe rules.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True vivification is general, both in reſpect of us, and in reſpect of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of us, it is diffuſed throughout the whole man; <hi>the very</hi> God <hi>of peace ſanctifie you wholly</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and I pray</hi> God <hi>that your whole ſpirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.23.</note> 
                     <hi>ſoul, and body may be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And. 2. In reſpect of Grace, it is in every Grace; I know it is a queſtion, whether all Graces are ſo connexed and chained together, that poſſible they cannot be ſevered? but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is truly anſwered, that in reſpect of habit they cannot be ſevered, though in reſpect of the act or exerciſe they may be ſevered; ſome Graces are more radical than others, as faith and love, and therefore they firſt appear; but as a man lives firſt the life of a plant, then of ſenſe, then of reaſon, though all were radically there at firſt; ſo it is in graces; experience tells us that ſome Chriſtians are eminent in ſome graces; and ſome in other graces; ſome have more love, and ſome more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and ſome more patience, and ſome more ſelf-denial; but all that are true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have each of theſe graces in ſome meaſure or other; or at leaſt they have them in habit, though not in the act; if vivication be true, there is a whole work of grace both in heart and life; as the light in the ayre runs through the whole hemiſphere, ſo the whole work of grace runs through, and is diffuſed through the whole man, ſoul, body, and ſpirit. O my ſoul, this may put thee to thy ſtudy, becauſe of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitutions or tempers of graces; thou mayeſt find this or that grace, this or that image of Chriſt clearly ſtampt on thy heart; but thou canſt not find ſuch and ſuch graces; in this caſe, fear not, for if in truth and ſincerity thou haſt but one grace, thou haſt the whole chaine of graces. But to ſpeak to ſome graces in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note>2. True vivification is a new life acting upon a new principle of Faith. <hi>The life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of</hi> God.

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:94897:190"/> is eſſcentially, radically, fundamentally life it ſelf, and by his incarnation, paſſion, reſurrection, he is life for his Saints; they live by him, and in him, and for him, and through him; he is the heart and liver of their Spiritual life. But as from the heart and liver there muſt be arteryes, and vains for maintenance of life and conveyance of blood throughout all the body; ſo from Chriſt there muſt be ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance to bring this to life unto us, and this is by faith; <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of</hi> God. O my ſoul, doſt thou live this life of faith on the Son of God? canſt thou make uſe of Chriſt in every ſtate, and in every condition? As for inſtance; in thy particular calling, doſt thou look to Chriſt for wiſdome, ſucceſs, bleſſing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? doſt thou ſay, <hi>if I have ill ſucceſs, I will yet go to</hi> Chriſt; <hi>it is he that ſet me here, and it is he will enable me?</hi> in caſe of proviſion, doſt thou run to Chriſt, and doſt thou hang upon him for all things needful? doſt thou ſay; <hi>If I want means,</hi> God <hi>will create means; he commands all means, and he can ſuddenly do whatſoever he will?</hi> In caſe of protection, doſt thou look unto Jeſus to be thy ſhield and protector? doſt thou mind the word of God to <hi>Abraham, Fear not Abraham, for I am</hi> God <hi>all-ſufficient,</hi>

The ſoul that is vivified hath <hi>a lively hope of glory</hi> on ſeveral grounds. As, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the promiſes of glory ſet down in the word; now on theſe promiſes hope faſtens her anchor; if Chriſt hath promiſed, how ſhould I but maintain lively hope? 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the firſt-fruits of the Spirit; there are ſometimes fore taſts of the glory, drops of heaven poured into a ſoul; whence it comfortably concludes, if I have the earneſt and firſt-fruits, ſurely in his time Jeſus Chriſt will give the harveſt. 3. Becauſe of Chriſts reſurrection unto glory; now he roſe as a common Perſon, and he went up into heaven as a common Perſon; whence hope is lively, ſaying, why ſhould I doubt, or deſpair, ſeeing, I am <hi>quickened together with Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and raiſed up together with Chriſt, and am made to ſit together with Chriſt, in heavenly places?</hi> Try, O my ſoul, by this ſign: Art thou lively in the hope of glory?
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:94897:191"/> doth thy heart leap and rejoyce within at a thought of thy inheritance in heaven? in a lively fountain the waters thereof will leap and ſparkle; ſo if thy hope be lively, thou wilt have living joys, living ſpeeches, living delights; amidſt all thy afflictions thou wilt ſay, theſe will not endure for ever; I my ſelf ſhall away ere long, Glory will come at laſt. O the ſweet of this life of hope! if thou feeleſt theſe ſtirrings it is an argument of thy vivification.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. True vivification acts all its dutyes upon a new principle of love to Chriſt; men not enlivened by Jeſus <hi>Chriſt</hi> may do much, and go far in outward ſervice, yea they may come to ſufferings, and yet without love to Chriſt all is loſt, all comes to nothing.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Though I ſpeak with tongues of men and Angels—though I have the gift of Propheſie, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledg, —though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all my goods to feed the poor;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and though I give my body to be burnt, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> All the reſt may be from the fleſh, and for the fleſh, and fleſhly ends; but a true Goſpel-love is from Chriſt, and tends to the Glory of Chriſt: <hi>For Love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 4.7.</note> But how may we know that all our actings are out of love to Jeſus Chriſt? I anſwer.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we act by the rule of Chriſt. <hi>If ye love me keep my commandements.— He that hath my Commandements and keepeth them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 14.15, 21.23, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>he it is that loveth me.— If any man love me, he will keep my commandements.</hi> He that loves Chriſt, he will look upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act, every ſervice, every performance, whether it be according to the rule of Chriſt, and then on he goes with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we act to the honour of Chriſt. We may pray, and hear, and preach, and act ſelf more then the honour of Jeſus Chriſt; whiles Chriſt ſhewed miracles, and fed his followers to the full, they cryed up Jeſus, and none like Jeſus; but when Chriſt was plain with them, <hi>ye ſeek me, not becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 6.26. Ver. 66.</note> 
                     <hi>and were filled;</hi> when he preſſed ſincerity upon them, and preparation for ſufferings, <hi>from that time many of his Diſciples went back, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more with him.</hi> Its no news for men to fall off when their ends fail; only they that love Chriſt look not at theſe outward things in reſpect of the honour of Jeſus Chriſt; and hence it is that in all their actings they will carry on the deſign of the Father in advancing the honour of the Son, whatever it coſt them. O my ſoul apply this to thy ſelf; if thou liveſt the life of love, if in all thy actings, duties, ſervices, thou art carried on with a principle of love to Jeſus Chriſt, it is a ſure ſign of thy vivification.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond queſtion, whether we increaſe and grow in our vivification? we may diſcover it thus.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We grow, when we are led on to the exerciſe of new Graces; this the Apoſtle calls adding of one Grace unto another:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>add to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledg, and to knowledg temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience Godlineſs, and to Godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs charity.</hi> At firſt a Chriſtian doth not exerciſe all Graces, though habitually all Graces may be planted in him, yet the exerciſe of them is not all at once, but by degrees. Thus the Church tells Chriſt, <hi>at our Gates are all manner of pleaſant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 7.13.</note> ſhe had all manner of fruits which ſhe had reſerved for <hi>Chriſt; new and old:</hi> ſhe had young converts, and more ſeetled profeſſors; or ſhe had new and old Graces, as others; ſhe added Grace to Grace, ſhe was led on from the exerciſe of one Grace, unto another new Grace: As wicked men are led on from one ſin to another, and ſo grow worſe and worſe; ſo godly men are led from one Grace to another;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.3, 4.</note> and ſo they increaſe, <hi>knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We grow, when we find new degrees of the ſame Grace added; as when love grows more fervent, when knowledg abounds, and hath a larger apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpiritual things; when faith goes on from mans caſting himſelf on Chriſt, to find ſweetneſs in Chriſt; and ſo to plerophory, or full aſſurance of faith: when God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow proceeds from mourning for ſin, as contrary to Gods holineſs; to mourn for it, is as contrary to him who loves us; which uſually follows after aſſurance; when obedience enlargeth its bounds,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.16.</note> and we abound more and more in the work of the Lord. <hi>I know thy works</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Thyatyra) I know thy works, and the laſt to be more than the firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:94897:191"/>3. We grow when the fruits and duties we perform grow more ripe, more ſpiritual, and more to the honour of Chriſt: it may be we pray not more, nor longer than ſometimes we uſed; it may be our prayers have not more wit, or memory, than ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they had; yet they are more ſavory, more ſpiritual, and more to Chriſt's honour than ſometimes they were: Now we muſt know that one ſhort prayer put up in faith, with a broken heart, and ayming at the honour of Chriſt, argues more of growth in grace, than prayers of a day long, and never ſo eloquent, without the like qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In every duty we ſhould look at their ends, and ayms; for if we debaſe our ſelves in the ſenſe of our own vileneſs, and emptineſs, and inability; and if we aym at God's honour, and power, and praiſe, and glory, it is a good ſign of growth; we call this ſpiritual part of duty, when it is from God, and through God, and to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We grow when we are more rooted in Chriſt; ſo the Apoſtle deſcribes it,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>a growing up unto him in all things.</hi> This is Scripture phraſe; growth of grace is uſually expreſſed by growing into Chriſt, <hi>but now in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> As if to grow in grace without him, were nothing, as indeed it is not.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18.</note> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, moral men, and others, may grow in vertues, but not in Chriſt. Come then, ſearch, and try whether we are more rooted in Chriſt: when a young plant is new ſet, the roots are a ſmall depth in the earth, one may pull them up with his hand; but as the tree ſhooteth up in height, ſo it ſtrikes the root deep and deeper downward, that no force can move it; ſo it is with us, we have not for degree ſo firm and near a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, at our firſt union; but the more we live with him, like good trees ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſight of all men, and bringing forth the fruits of righteouſneſs, the more we come to root downwards by a more firm faith, and firm confidence. Our union is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that which uniteth us; now at the firſt, faith is but weak, like a ſmoaking wick, or a poor bruiſed reed; but whiles faith is drawing the Spirit away from Chriſt, the more it exerciſeth, the more it is ſtrengthened; even as in babes, their powers every day, at firſt are feeble; but the more they feed and exerciſe, by ſo much the more they put forth their ſtrength in all their operations: time was, that <hi>Peters</hi> faith was ſo weak, that at the voice of a Damoſel, <hi>Peter</hi> was ſhaken; but by walking, while in Chriſt he was ſo rooted, that neither threatnings, whippings, impriſonment, conventings before great powers, nor any other thing could ſhake him: you may object, if we are not at firſt rooted in Chriſt, a weak faith may be quite overthrown; we may then fall away; true, if we be not rooted in any manner; but this we are at our firſt ſetting into Chriſt by faith; only this <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of is of an higher degree of rooting, which doth not only ſhut out falling away, but very ſhaking and tottering, in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: ſurely this is not the ſtate of every believer; no, no, it is only the condition of ſuch, who have long walked in Chriſt, and are grown in grace, holineſs, vivification.</p>
                  <p>O my ſoul, try now the growth of vivification by theſe few ſigns; art thou led on to the exerciſes of new graces, adding grace to grace? doſt thou find new degrees of the ſelf ſame grace? is thy love more hot, thy faith more firm? all thy boughs more laden and filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs? are all thy dutyes more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual? are thy ends more raiſed to ayme at God, to ſanctifie him, and to debaſe thy ſelf? art thou more rooted in Chriſt? in all thy dutyes, graces and gracious act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; haſt thou learnt habitual to ſay, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me?</hi> doſt thou intereſt Chriſt more and more in all thou doſt? doſt thou know and affect Chriſt more and more? Oh when would an ambitious courtier be weary of being graced by his Prince? when would a worlding be weary of having the world come in upon him? why ſhouldſt thou O my ſoul be weary of inſinuating thy ſelf by faith and affection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; come, ſcearch, try; it may be little winds have formerly ſhaken thee, but ſo it is, that inſencibly, and thou knoweſt not how, thy root is ſtruck lower and lower in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; and now thou art not ſo ſoon ſhaken with every wind; ſurely thy hope is well grounded; thou haſt a part in Chriſts reſurrection; it is thine, even thine.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. LEt us <hi>believe in Jeſus</hi> as carrying on the great work of our Salvation for us in his reſurrection.

Scrupulous ſouls may object, <hi>is it poſſible that Chriſt ſhould riſe, and that I ſhould riſe with him, and in him? is it poſſible that Chriſt ſhould dye as a common Perſon for my ſins? and that Chriſt ſhould riſe, and by his reſurrection ſhould be juſtified as a common perſon in my room?

                  <p n="1">1. For directions of faith in reference to Chriſt's reſurrection, obſerve theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith muſt directly go to Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Faith muſt go to Chriſt, not only as made under the directive part of the Law by his life, but under the penal part by his death; of all theſe before.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Faith muſt go to Chriſt as God in the fleſh, made under the directive and penal part of the Law, and as quickened by the Spirit. <hi>He was put to death in the fleſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) and quickened by the Spirit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note> And accordingly muſt be the method, and order of our faith; after we have looked on Chriſt as dead in the fleſh, we muſt go on to ſee him as quickened by the Spirit;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17.</note>

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:94897:192"/> 
                     <hi>that Chriſt muſt needs ſuffer and riſe from the dead.</hi> This was the way of the Apoſtles preaching; they told them an hiſtory (I ſpeak it with reverence) <hi>of one Jeſus Chriſt, that was the word of God, and that was become man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 17.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and how he was crucified at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and how he was raiſed from the dead;</hi> and all this in a plain, ſimple, ſpiritual way and manner; and while they were telling thoſe bleſſed truths, the Spirit fell upon the people, and they believed, and had faith wrought in them. <hi>Faith is not wrought ſo much in the way of ratiocination, as by the Spirit of God, coming upon the ſouls of people by the Relation or repreſentation of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſoul.</hi> And this our Lord himſelf hints, <hi>as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.14.</note> 
                     <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> When the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſtung, God ſo ordered, that the very beholding of the brazen Serpent ſhould bring help (though we know not how) to thoſe that were wounded and ſtung by thoſe fiery Serpents; ſo God hath ordained in his bleſſed wiſdom that the diſcovery of Jeſus Chriſt, as crucified and raiſed, as humbled and exalted, ſhould be a means of faith; come then, ſet we before us, Chriſt raiſed; not only Chriſt crucified, but Chriſt raiſed, is the object of faith; and in that reſpect we muſt <hi>look up to Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Faith in going to Chriſt is raiſed from the dead, or as quickned by the Spirit, it is principally, and mainly to look to the end, purpoſe, intent, and deſign of Chriſt in his reſurrection; very devils may believe the hiſtory of Chriſt's reſurrection,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>they believe and tremble;</hi> but the Saints and people of God are to look at the meaning of Chriſt, why he roſe from the dead; now the ends are either ſupream, or ſubordinate. 1. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream end was God's Glory, and that was the meaning of Chriſt's prayer, <hi>Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 17.1. Rom. 6.4.</note> 
                     <hi>the hour is come, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorifie thee;</hi> with which agrees the Apoſtle, <hi>he roſe again from the dead to the glory of the Father.</hi> 2. The ſubordinate ends were many; As, 1. That he might tread on the Serpents head. 2. That he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil. 3. That he might be the firſt fruits of them that ſleep. 4. That he might aſſure our faith that he is the word, and that he is able to keep that which we have committed to him againſt that day. 5. That he might be juſtified in the Spirit; as he was begotten in the womb by the Spirit; led up and down in the Spirit, offered up by the eternal Spirit, ſo he was raiſed from the dead by the Spirit, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Spirit at his reſurrection. Chriſt was under the greateſt attainder that ever man was, he ſtood publickly charged with the guilt of a world of ſins, and if he had not been juſtified by the Spirit, he had ſtill lyen under the blame of all, and had been liable to the execution of all; and therefore he was raiſed up from the power of death, that he might be declared as a righteous perſon. 6. That he might juſtifie us in his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when he was juſtified, all the elect were vertually and really juſtified in him; that act of God which paſt on him, was drawn up in the name of all his Saints: as whatever benefit or priviledge God meant for us, he firſt of all beſtowed it on Chriſt; thus God meaning to ſanctifie us, he ſanctified Chriſt firſt, and God meaning to juſtifie us, he juſtifies Chriſt firſt; ſo whatever benefit or priviledg he beſtowed on Chriſt, he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not on him for himſelf, but as he was a common Perſon, and one re-reſenting us. Thus Chriſt was ſanctified inſtead of us, <hi>for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through thy truth:</hi> and thus Chriſt was juſtified in ſtead of us, <hi>for as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all for condemnation, even ſo by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of one, the free gift came on all men unto juſtification.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>O my Soul, Look to this main deſign of Chriſt in his riſing again; and if thou haſt any faith, O ſet thy Faith on work to draw this down into thy Soul. But here is a queſtion, how ſhould I manage my Faith? or how ſhould I act my Faith to draw down the vertue of Chriſt's reſurrection for my Vivification; I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Go to the Well-head, look into the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. This one act contains in it theſe particulars; As, 1. That <hi>I</hi> muſt go out of my ſelf to ſomething elſe; this is that check that lyes upon that work of Grace, to keep out pride, that Faith ſees the whole good of the ſoul in a Principle extraneous, even the ſprings of Jeſus Chriſt. Alas! if this Vivification were in me, or in my power, what ſwellings and excreſcencies of pride ſhould <hi>I</hi> quickly nouriſh? God therefore hath placed it in another, that <hi>I</hi> may be kept low; and that <hi>I</hi> may go out of my ſelf to ſeek it where it is. 2. That I muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute wholly,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> freely, joyfully, all that I am, to Jeſus Chriſt, and to the effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Grace.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10.</note> 
                     <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> And <hi>by the Grace of God I am what I am;</hi> and, <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> The life of grace ſprings only from the life and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore as I muſt deny my ſelf, ſo I muſt attribute all to him from whom it comes. 3. I muſt lye at his feet with an humble expectation of, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency upon him, and him alone for the ſupplies of grace; this was the Apoſtles practice: <hi>O that I may be found in him! O that I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection! O that by any meanes I might obtain unto the reſurrection of the dead!</hi> he lay at Chriſts feet with an humble expectation to feel the Power of Chriſt's reſurrection, in raiſing him firſt from the death of ſin to the life of grace, &amp; after from death of nature to the life of glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Lay to theſe ſprings thy mouth of Faith; it is not enough to have all the treaſuries of grace, all the actings of Chriſt for thee, layd before thee, but thou muſt act thy faith upon that object; O then go to Chriſt's reſurrection and believe, make a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thoſe glorious effects of Chriſt's reſurrection upon thy ſoul. Say, <hi>Lord thou dyedſt that I might dye to ſin, and thou waſt raiſed from the death that I might be raiſed to newneſs of life. Come Lord, and quicken my dying ſparks, give me to lay hold on Christ's reſurrection, give me to adhere to it, and to reſt upon it, and to cloſe with it; I ſee without faith I am nere a whit the better for Chriſts reſurrection; and thy commands are upon me; open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it: why Lord, I believe, help thou my unbeliefe.</hi> This faith is neceſſary to our vivification as well as Chriſt.<note place="margin">Pſal 81.10.</note> Chriſt is the fountain of life, but faith is the meanes of life;<note place="margin">Mark. 9.24.</note> the power and original of life is intirely reſerved to Jeſus Chriſt, but faith is the radical band on our part, whereby we are tyed unto Chriſt, and live in Chriſt; and thus ſaith Chriſt himſelf, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life.</hi> Is that all? no, <hi>he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet he ſhall live.</hi> And <hi>I am the bread of life.</hi> Is that all?<note place="margin">Joh. 11.25.</note> no; <hi>he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 66.11.</note>3. <hi>Suck and be ſatisfied, milk out and be delighted.</hi> Chriſt's reſurrection is a breſt of conſolation; there is in it abundance of life and glory, and therefore we ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a little, but much; the word <hi>ſuck,</hi> is as much as to exact on Chriſt; draw hard from Chriſt; the more we exerciſe faith, the more we have of Jeſus Chriſt and of Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; there is a depth in Chriſts reſurrection that can never be fadomed; when the ſoul hath as much as its narrow hand can graſp, whole Chriſt is too big to be incloſed in mortal arms; onely the longer our arm of faith is, the more we ſhall graſp of him; and therfore ſuck, and pull, and draw harde. And to this purpoſe—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Pray for an increaſe of faith, complain to Chriſt of the ſhortneſs of thy arm, tell him thou canſt not believe as thou wouldſt, thou canſt not get in ſo much of Chriſt into thy ſoul as thou deſireſt, thy Vivification is very poor and ſmall; Oh when Chriſt hears a ſoul complain of drawfiſhneſs in faith and grace, then is he ready to let out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs even grace for grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Act thy faith vigorouſly on Chriſt's reſurrection for a further degree of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, activity, and lively abillity of grace. Chriſt is an ever-flowing fountain, and he would have believers to partake abundantly of what is in him; he cannot abide that
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:94897:193"/> any ſhould content themſelves with a preſent ſtock of grace; Chriſt is not as a ſtream that fails, or as a channel that runs dry; Chriſt is not as water in a ditch, which hath no liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpring to feed it; no, no; Chriſt is the fountain of life, he is the chief ordinance of life that ever God ſet up. I know there are other means of Chriſts appointment, but if thou wilt live at the ſpring, and dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> in there, yea drink abundantly according to the overflowings of this fountain, O the life, and growth of life that would come in! Oh the vertue of Chriſt's reſurrection that (Chriſt's Spirit meeting and aſſiſting) would flow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſoul for thy vivification.</p>
                  <p>Thus for directions; now for the encouragements of our faith to believe in Chriſt's reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider the excellency of this object. A ſight of Chriſt in his beauty and glory would raviſh ſouls, and draw them to run after him: the wiſe Merchant would not buy the pearl, till he knew it to be of excellent price; great things are eagerly ſought for; Chriſt raiſed, Chriſt glorified, is an excellent object; O who would not ſell all to buy this pearl? who would not believe?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider of the power, vertue, and influence of this object into all that golden chain of priviledges; <hi>if Chriſt be not raiſed, you are yet in your ſins;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17; 18.</note> 
                     <hi>then they alſo which are fallen a ſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> From the reſurrection of Chriſt flows all thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, even from juſtification to ſalvation. The firſt is clear, and therefore all the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider that Chriſt's reſurrection and the effects of it are nothing unto us, if we do not believe; it is faith that brings down the particular ſweetneſs and comforts of Chriſt's reſurrection unto our ſouls: it is faith that puts us in the actual poſſeſſion of Chriſt's reſurrection; whatſoever Chriſt is to us before faith, yet really we have no benefit by it until we believe; it is faith that takes hold of all that Chriſt hath done for us; and gives us the actual enjoyment of it, oh let not the work ſtick in us! what, is Chriſt riſen from the dead? and ſhall we not eye this Chriſt, and take him home to our ſelves by faith? the Apoſtle tells us that <hi>he that believed not, hath made God a lyar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.10.</note> 
                     <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe be believeth not the record that God hath given of his Son:</hi> Unbelief belyes God in all that he hath done for us. O take heed of this, without faith what are we better for Chriſt's reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider of the tenders, offers, apparitions that Chriſt raiſed makes of himſelf to our ſouls? when firſt he aroſe (to confirm the faith of his Diſciples he offers himſelf, and appears to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> to the other women, to <hi>Peter, Thomas,</hi> and all the reſt; and all thoſe apparitions were on this account that they might believe,<note place="margin">Joh. 29.31.</note> 
                     <hi>theſe things are written that ye might believe.</hi> In like manner Chriſt at this day offers himſelf in the Goſpel of grace; and by his Spirit he appears to ſouls. Methinks we ſhould not hear a Sermon of Chriſt's reſurrection, but we ſhould imagine as if we ſaw him, <hi>whoſe head and haires are white like wool, as white as ſnow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 1.14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire; whoſe feet are like unto fine braſs, as if they burned in a furnace; whoſe voyce is as the ſound of many waters:</hi> or if we are dazled with his glory, methinks at leaſt we ſhould hear his voyce, as if he ſaid, <hi>fear not, I am the firſt and the laſt, I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold I am alive for evermore. Amen.</hi> q. d. Come,<note place="margin">Ver. 17, 18.</note> caſt your ſouls on me; it is I that have conquered ſin, death, and hell for you; it is I that have broke the ſerpents head, that have took away the ſting of death, that have cancelled the bond of the hand-writing againſt you, that have in my hands a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance and pardon of your ſins; come, take it, take me, and take all with me; ſee your names written in the acquittance, that I tender; take out the copy of it in your own hearts; only believe in him who is riſen again for your juſtification.—O my ſoul what ſayſt thou to this ſtill ſweet voyce of Chriſt? ſhall he who is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of men, and glory of Angels deſire thee to believe, and wilt thou not ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it? Oh how ſhould I blame thee for thy unbelief? what aſperſions doth it caſt on Chriſt? he hath done all things well, he hath ſatisfied wrath, fullfilled the Law; and God hath acquitted him, pronounced him juſt; faith is contented, he can deſire no more; but thou ſayſt by unbelief that Chriſt hath done nothing at all, unbelief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth Chriſt is not dead, or at leaſt not riſen from the dead; unbelief profeſſeth that juſtice is not ſatisfied, that no juſtification is procured, that the wrath of God is now as open to deſtroy us as ever it was. Oh that Chriſt ſhould be crucified again in our hearts by our unbelief; come, take Chriſt upon his tenders and offers, embrace him with both armes.</p>

                  <p>I might thus go on to conſider other paſſages in other Apparitions, but are not theſe enow to draw thy love? Oh what love was this! Oh what humility was this? that Chriſt after his reſurrection ſhould converſe with men during the ſpace of fourty days; worthy he was after ſo many ſorrows, ſufferings, reproaches, after ſo cruel ignominious, and bitter a death, immediately to have rid his triumph to glory; And for the confirmation of his Diſciples faith, he might have commanded the Angels to have preached his reſurrection; oh, no, he himſelf would ſtay in perſon, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would make it out by many infallible proofs that he was riſen again; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would by his own example learn us a leſſon of love, of meekneſs, of patience, in waiting after ſufferings for the reward.</p>
                  <p>Methinks a few of theſe paſſages ſhould ſet all our hearts on a flame of love; we love earth, and earthly things; we dig into the veins of the earth for thick clay; but if Chriſt be riſen <hi>ſet your affections on things above; and not on things on the earth.</hi> Oh if the love of Chriſt were but in us,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.1, 2,</note> as the love of the world is in baſe worldlings, it would make us wholly to deſpiſe this world, it would make us to forget it, as worldly love makes a man to forget his God; Nay it would be ſo ſtrong and ardent, and rooted in our ſouls, that we ſhould not be able voluntary and freely to think on any thing elſe but Jeſus Chriſt; we ſhould not then fear contempt, or care for diſgrace, or the reproaches of men; we ſhould not then fear death,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55, 57.</note> or the grave, or hell, or devils; but we ſhould ſing in triumph, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?

                  <p n="8">8. LEt us <hi>Call on Jeſus;</hi> that is to ſay —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us pray that Chriſt's reſurrection may be ours, and that we may be more and more aſſured of it.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.10.</note> Let us ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>O that I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection;</hi> O that I may find the working of that power in my ſoul, which was ſhewed in the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead; O that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of holineſs, which quickened Chriſt from the dead; would by the ſame glorious power beget holineſs, and faith, and love, and all other graces in my poor ſoul, O that Chriſt would by his reſurrection apply his active, and paſſive obedience to me; O that he would be to me the Lord of the living, and the Prince of life, that he would overcome in me the death of ſin, and that he would regenerate, quicken, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and faſhion me by the power of godlineſs to become like himſelf. O that all the vertue, power, priviledges, and influences of Chriſt's reſurrection might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on me, and that I might feel them working in me every day more and more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us praiſe God for Chriſt's reſurrection, and for all the priviledges flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Chriſt's reſurrection into our ſouls,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath begotten us again by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> Chriſt is riſen, by his reſurrection he hath juſtified, ſanctified, quickened, ſaved our ſouls; and therefore, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſurely God requires a thouſand thouſand <hi>Hallelujah</hi>'s, and that we ſhould bleſs him upon a thouſand-ſtringed inſtrument: here is fewel enough, the Lord kindle a great fire in every one of our hearts, to burn out all our luſts, and to enflame all our hearts with a love to Jeſus Chriſt. Can we ever too much praiſe him for all his actings in our behalf? are not all God's creatures called upon to rejoyce with us, and to bleſs God for his redeeming of us? <hi>Sing O ye heavens, for the Lord hath done it, ſhout ye lower part of the earth,</hi>

                     <hi>break forth into ſinging ye mountains, O forreſt, and every tree therein, for the Lord hath redeemed</hi> Jacob, <hi>and glorified himſelf in Iſrael.</hi> This is the duty we ſhall do in heaven, and I believe we are never more in heaven (whiles on earth) then when we are in this exerciſe of praiſing God, and bleſſing God for Jeſus Chriſt. Come, let us praiſe God for Chriſt, and eſpecially on this day, called therefore <hi>the Lord's day,</hi> becauſe of the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt: it is the deſign of God, to glorify Chriſt redeeming us, as much, or more than he glorified himſelf creating us; and therefore he purpoſely unhinged the Sabboth from the laſt day to the firſt day of the week, that it might be ſpent as a week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day of praiſe and thankſgiving for the more glorious work of our redemption; that love might not only be equally admired with power, but even go before it. It is the advice of a godly Divine, that we ſhould <hi>improve the happy opportunity of the Lord's day wholly to devote our ſelves to his work.</hi> And he adviſeth Miniſters and others, that <hi>They ſpend more of thoſe days in praiſe and thanksgiving,</hi>

                  <p n="9">9. LEt us <hi>conform to Jeſus</hi> in reſpect of his reſurrection.—</p>
                  <p>In this particular I ſhall examine theſe Queries. 1. Wherein we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? 2. How this conformity is wrought? 3. What are the means of this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity as on our parts?</p>
                  <p>For the firſt wherein we muſt conform? I anſwer in a word, in our vivification. There is a reſemblance of our vivification to Chriſt's reſurrection; and if we would know wherein the Analogy, or reſemblance of our vivification to Chriſt's reſurrection doth more eſpecially conſiſt; the Apoſtle's anſwer is very expreſs,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father; even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life.</hi> Chriſt's reſurrection was to newneſs of life; it was a new life, a life dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which he lived before, and ſo is our vivification a new life; it is a life of a new principle; of new actings, of a new ſtate, of a new relation, of a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and of a new kind, or manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a life of a new principle, before vivification our principle was the fleſh, or word, or devil; <hi>In time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.2.</note> 
                     <hi>according to the Prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> but now we have a new principle, a Spirit of holineſs, or ſanctification, the Spirit of God; even the ſame ſpirit which dwelt in the humane nature of Chriſt, and raiſed him; <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.11.</note> it is an in-dwelling Spirit; even as the ſoul dwells in the body, ſo doth the holy Ghoſt dwell in the ſoul of a regenerate perſon, animating, and actuating, and enlivening it. This is the new principle that God puts in us after vivification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a life of new actings. According to our principle, ſo be our actings;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.5.</note> 
                     <hi>They that are after the fleſh do mind the things of the fleſh; but they that are of the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</hi> If ſome men hear of a good bargain they mind it, they find their ſouls going on with much activity, there is ſomething in them proportionable to that which is propounded; but if they hear of Divine love, and of the riches of Grace, they find their ſouls flat, unmoveable, and dead, they mind no ſuch things; now on the other ſide, they that are vivified, according to their principle, they put forth their power more or leſs; if they hear of the glorious things of the Goſpel, they find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings (unleſs it be under a temptation) they find their ſouls drawn out to cloſe with the goodneſs of the thing propounded: <hi>They mind the things of the Spirit, (i.e.)</hi> they muſe, and meditate, and think on theſe things; they affect them, and love them, and like them, they care for them, and ſeek after them with might and main; they <hi>live in the Spirit,</hi> they <hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> they <hi>are led by the Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.26. Rom. 8.1.14. Rom. 7.6.</note> they <hi>ſerve in newneſs of the Spirit.</hi> How might we try our vivification even by theſe actings of our principle within? what? do we mind the things of the Spirit? do we find things heavenly and ſpiritually to be ſweet, and ſavoury, and beſt pleaſing to us? is the Sabbath our delight; do we long for it before it come? do we rejoyce in it when it is come? do we conſecrate it as <hi>glorious to the Lord?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 58.13.</note> do we come to the exerciſes of Religion, whether publick or private, with much delight, and with chearfulneſs, as to a feaſt? what is this but the life of God? but if theſe things be harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, if the Sabbath be a burthen, if holy exerciſes be irkſome and tedious,<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.4.</note> if in attending on the Word we are heavy and drouzy, and we find no reliſh, no ſweet, no ſavour in the ointments of Chriſts, no goings out of the ſoul with an activity to the things propounded, O then deceive not our ſelves, we have no good evidence of our vivification.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a life of a new ſtate; before vivification we are in an unjuſtified eſtate; ſins are unpardoned, we are unreconciled; <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you</hi> (ſaid the Apoſtle to his <hi>Corinthians) but now ye are waſhed, now ye are ſanctified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note> 
                     <hi>now ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> This juſtification denotes a ſtate, and is univerſal and unalterable. I know Arminians deny ſuch a ſtate, for as by their Doctrine no man can be abſolutely Elected till he die, ſo neither abſolutely
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:94897:197"/> juſtified; for (ſay they) he may fall into ſuch ſins, as that though formerly juſtified, yet now he may be condemned; yea, to day he may be juſtified; and to morrow thrown out of that eſtate. But againſt this we hold, that thoſe that are once juſtified, are never again caſt out of God's favour. As Chriſt once died, but roſe again never to die more, death hath no more power over him; ſo a juſtified man once allyed to God through Jeſus Chriſt doth from that time forward as neceſſarily live, as Chriſt himſelf by whom he doth live; there is an immortal and indiſſoluble union betwixt Chriſt the Head, and every Believer; our juſtification depends not on our own ſtrength, but it is built on Chriſt himſelf, who is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever; and hence it is that a juſtified man can no more ceaſe to live in this ſtate of juſtification, than Chriſt can ceaſe to live in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a life of new relations; this immediately follows our ſtate: if once we are juſtified; then we are related to God, and Chriſt, and to the Covenant of Grace. 1. To God. Before we were vivified, God and we ſtood at a diſtance, God was our enemy, and we were his enemies; <hi>At that time</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye were without God in the world,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. And now the anſwer to this call, is wrought up in the renewed will; as thus.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The will ſummons all its confidences, and calls them off from every other bottom, to beſtow them wholly upon Chriſt; and this conſiſts in our voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of all other helps, excepting Jeſus Chriſt alone; now the ſoul ſayes to Idols, <hi>Get ye hence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the works of our hands, ye are our Gods.

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:94897:198"/> unmatchable excellency, which appears in the way of life and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. It calls home dependance from every other object.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereupon there is a willing and chearfull receiving of Chriſt, and reſignation of our ſelves to his actual diſpoſe, to quicken us, and ſave us in his own way. A great part of the anſwer of Faith to the call of Chriſt lyes in this; for as Faith ſees life and ſalvation in the hands of Chriſt, ſo it conſiders it to be given forth in the methods of Chriſt; and ſo believing lyes not only in aſſent, but conſent of heart,<note place="margin">John 1.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that Chriſt ſhall ſave us in his own way; this is called <hi>A receiving of Chriſt; As many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God.</hi> Many a ſoul would be ſaved by Chriſt, that ſticks and boggles at his methods; they will not paſs to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by holineſs; nor ſet him up as a King and Lord, whom they could conſent to ſet up as a Saviour: Oh but now Chriſt that <hi>ſtood at the door, and knocked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3.10.</note> is received in; conſent hath made up the match, and the door is opened that never ſhall be ſhut again.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Upon this follows the ſouls reſting and relying; the ſouls confidence and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Jeſus Chriſt for life and for ſalvation; this cloſeth up the whole buſineſs of believing unto righteouſneſs; thoſe various expreſſions uſed in Scripture of <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our way and ſelves to God; of caſting our care upon God, of rolling our ſelves on him, of truſting in him, of hoping in his mercy,</hi> &amp;c. wrapt up faith in this affiance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, not without ſome mixture of confidence, and reſolved reſting upon Jeſus Chriſt: a clear beholding of God in Chriſt, and of Chriſt in the promiſes, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuch variety and fulneſs of Arguments to bear up hope and affiance, that the heart is reſolved: and ſo reſolved that we commit our ſelves, and give our ſouls in charge to Chriſt, <hi>I know whom I have believed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.19. 2 Tim. 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and I am perſwaded he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The upſhot of all, is this, that the ſame cloſe which the ſoul makes in believing with Jeſus Chriſt as to juſtification, and righteouſneſs, is not fruitleſs to this effect of conveying life and vertue from Jeſus Chriſt as to grace and holineſs; for that union which then and thereby comes to be enjoyned with Chriſt, is ſuch an union as is fruitful in begetting a quickening power and principle in the heart; and this is that which we ordinarily intend by ſaying, <hi>ſaving faith to be operative;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 2.16.</note> that faith which brings forth nothing of holineſs, what is it but a dead faith? <hi>As the body without the Spirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo.</hi> Juſtification and ſanctification are twins of a birth; and hence it is, that vivification (which is one part of ſanctification) is wrought in the ſoul after the ſelf-ſame manner: As firſt, the underſtanding is illight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened. 2. The will is changed. 3. All the Affections are renewed. 4. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals being quickened, there enſueth the renewing of the body with the outward actions, life, and converſation. And now is fulfilled that ſaying of Chriſt in a ſpiritual ſenſe,<note place="margin">John 5.25.</note> 
                     <hi>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> Now is the ſoul vivified, now it begins to live the life of God, now it feels the power of Chriſt's reſurrection, and is made conformable to it: And immediately upon this, joy is made in heaven by the Angels,<note place="margin">Luke 15.24.</note> God himſelf applauding it, <hi>For this my Son was dead, and is alive; he was loſt, and is found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is the ſtate of vivification wrought. I know it is not in all men after one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for every circumſtance; the methods of God are exceeding various; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> I have ſometimes concerning this, deſired the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of other thoughts, whom I looked upon as ſuch, who had more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary communication with Chriſt's Spirit; and from one of ſuch I received this anſwer, <hi>I muſt profeſs to you, I have in all my ſpeculations in divinity found disſatisfaction in the writings of men in nothing more, than is the work of clear and diſtinct conceptions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regeneration; which yet is of ſuch a Cardinal importance, is, that the great doors of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven move upon the hinges of it; the Lord enlighten us more, for we ſee but in part, and propheſie but in part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the third queſtion, what are the means of this conformity, or vivification which we muſt uſe on our parts? I ſhall anſwer herein both to the ſtate, and growth of our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wait and Attend upon God in the miniſtry of the word, this is a means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt ordinarily effecteth this vivification. By this meanes it was that thoſe dead bones were quickened in <hi>Ezekel</hi>'s propheſie, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Prophets propheſying upon them. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, ſon of man,—propheſie upon theſe bones,</hi>

                        </gap>d;</hi> And by this means it is that dead ſouls are quickened; the Miniſtry of the Word is the Trumpet of Jeſus Chriſt, when that ſounds, who knows but he may quicken the dead? hearken therefore to this Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Act ſaith upon the Lord Jeſus as to juſtification. As is the clearneſs and fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſouls in bottoming our ſelves on Chriſt for righteouſneſs, ſo will be our quickneſs,<note place="margin">Luke 7.47.</note> and ſucceſsfull pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many manſions, if it were not ſo, I would have told you, but I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, ye may be alſo.</hi> Some infer hence, as if there ſhould be many outer courts, and many different places or ſtates in glory; and yet there is one place whither the Saints ſhould arrive at laſt, which was not then ready for them, and was not to be entred into, until the entrance of our Lord had made the preparation.

But our Perfection is not in reſpect of a more glorious place, but in reſpect of that perfection whereof all the faithfull ſhall be made partakers as well in body as in ſoul, at the reſurrection of the juſt. Thus far I grant, that no ſoul ever entred into Heaven but by the vertue and power of Chriſt's Aſcention, and that no ſoul and body joyntly ever aſcended (except Chriſts types) before Chriſt himſelf opened thoſe doors and lead the way; and in this reſpect he is called, <hi>The forerunner of his People.</hi>

In reſpect of our evidence and aſſurance; this is the ſign that Chriſt hath finiſhed the work of our redemption upon the earth; firſt, he was to act as our Surety, and then he was to aſcend as our Head, our Advocate, as the firſt-fruits, the Captain, the Prince of life, the Author of ſalvation, the forerunner of his people.</p>

                     <note place="margin">John. 16.8, 9, 10.</note> If Chriſt had not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all righteouſneſs, there had been no going to heaven for him, nor remaining there; certainly God would have ſent him down again to have done the reſt, and the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhould have ſeen him with ſhame ſent back again; but his aſcenſion to heaven proclaims openly. 1. That he hath compleatly finiſhed the work he had to do for us here, that no more was to be done in this world for us, that the ſatisfactory work to juſtice was in it ſelf finiſhed. 2. That God was well pleaſed with Jeſus Chriſt, and with what he had done and ſuffered for us; yea, God was ſo infinitely taken with him, and his oblation after his ſufferings, as that he thinks it not fit to let him ſtay above forty days longer in this world; he cannot be without him in heaven, but he takes him up into glory, and gives him a name above every name. 3. That we have our ſhare in heaven with him; he went not up as a ſingle perſon, but vertually, or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically he carried up all the Elect with him into glory: or otherwiſe how ſhould the Spirit convince the world by his aſcenſion of their righteouſneſs? or otherwiſe how ſhould the Son of God convince his Father by his Aſcenſion of his righteouſneſs? I look upon Jeſus Chriſt going into Heaven, as a confident Debtor after payment going into a Court, and ſaying, <hi>Who hath any thing to lay to his charge? all is paid, let the law take his courſe;</hi> when Chriſt entred into heaven, he ſeemed thus to challenge Juſtice, <hi>Make room here for me and mine, who ſhould hinder? hath the law any thing to ſay to theſe poor ſouls for whom I dyed? if any in heaven can make objection,</hi>

That he hath a new deſign to be acted in heaven for us: he is taken up into glory that he may act gloriouſly the ſecond part of out righteouſneſs, I mean that he might apply it, and ſend down his Spirit to convince us of it. He acted one part in the fleſh, in the habit of a beggar, cloathed with rags; but now he is gone to act the perſon of a Prince in robes of glory, and all this to manage our ſalvation in the richeſt way that may be. Three great things Chriſt acts for us now in glory. Firſt, he is in place of an advocate for us, <hi>He liveth to intercede for us.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> He is always begging of favour and love for us, he lyes there to ſtop whatever plea may be brought in againſt us by the devil, or Law; yea, he is there to get our freſh pardons for new ſins. Secondly, he is the great provider and caterer for us;<note place="margin">John 14.2.</note> he is laying in a great ſtock and ſtore of glory for us againſt we come there; <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many manſions.— I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt went before to take up

                     <hi>far above all principallity, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> Some deſcribe this Seſſion at Gods right hand to be all one with his reigning in equal power and glory with the Father, but the Son hath alwayes ſo reigned, and the holy Ghoſt hath alwayes ſo reigned, who yet is not ſaid in Scripture to ſit at the right hand of the Father, I believe therefore there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Seſſion or Reign of Chriſt which doth difference it from that reigning Power and Glory of the Father, and of the Son as only God, and of the holy Ghoſt; and if we would know what that is; I would call it an actual adminiſtration of his Kingdom, or an immediate executing of his Power and Glory over every creature as Mediator. There is a natural, and a diſpenſatory Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt; for the firſt, the Father reigns immediatly by the Son, but by the holy Ghoſt the Father doth not reign immediatly, but through the Son; the ſame order is to be kept in their power, which is in the Perſons; the Father reigns not by himſelf, but of himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is of none; the Son reigneth by himſelf, not of himſelf, becauſe he is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father; the holy Ghoſt reigneth by himſelf, but from the Father and the Son, from whom he doth proceed. And as in the natural, ſo in the diſpenſatory Kingdom, the Father reigns immediatly by the Son as Mediator; and hence it is that the Son as Mediator is only ſaid to ſit at Gods right hand, becauſe the right of actual adminiſtration, or immediate execution of the Sovereign power is appropriate and peculiar to the Son, as Mediator betwixt God and man. And this made Chriſt to ſay, <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John. 5.22.</note> as Mediator. You may object, Chriſt was Mediator immediately after his incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he did not actually adminiſter his Kingdom then. I Anſwer, it is true; Chriſt for a time did by a voluntary diſpenſation empty himſelf, and laid aſide the right of actual adminiſtration of his Kingdom; but immediatly after his Aſcenſion, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by voluntary diſpenſation reſigned it to the Son again; <hi>Come now, ſaith the Father, and take thou power over every creature, till the time that all things ſhall be ſubdued under thee.</hi> This right the one relinquiſhed in the time of that humiliation of himſelf, and this right the other conferred at the time of the exaltation of his Son.</p>

                     <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, ſit thou on my right hand.</hi> The Lord ſaid to my Lord] <hi>(i.e.)</hi> God ſaid to Chriſt: now Chriſt was not <hi>David's</hi> Lord meerly as man, but as God.

                     <hi>in as much as he is the Son of man.</hi> In the adminiſtration of his Kingdom the man-hood of Chriſt doth concur, as an Inſtrument working with his God-head.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and not only to the one nature of Chriſt, whether Divine or Humane, Or it is attributed to Chriſt as Mediator; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he is called an high Prieſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.1.</note> 
                     <hi>We have ſuch an high Prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the heavens.</hi>—And in which reſpect he is called a Prince,<note place="margin">Acts 5.31.</note> 
                     <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince, and a Saviour.</hi> Now Chriſt is not a Prieſt and a Prince meerly according to one Nature, whether Divine or Humane. I deny not but Chriſt had a natural Kingdom with his Father as God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world; but this Kingdom as God-man Chriſt had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Aſenſion into heaven. So then Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God by a mediatory action, which he executeth according to both natures, the word working what pertaineth to the word, and the fleſh what appertaineth to the fleſh; Chriſt is Mediator as God and man, and glory hath redounded unto him as God and man, and living in this glory he ruleth and governeth his Church as God and man, he aſcended indeed into heaven in his humanity only, but he ſitteth at the right hand of God as Mediator in reſpect of both natures. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> attribute this Seſſion at God's right hand only to the humane nature of Chriſt; they ſay this Seſſion is nothing elſe but the elevating of his humane nature to the full and free uſe of ſome of the divine properties, as of omnipotency, omniſcience, omnipreſence; the ground of this error is, that they ſuppoſe upon the union of the two Natures in Chriſt, a real communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the divine properties to follow; ſo that the humane nature is made truly omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, omniſcient, omnipreſent, not by any confuſion of properties, nor yet by any bare communion and concourſe of it to the ſame effect, each nature working that which belongeth to it with commuion of the other, (for this we grant) but by a real do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by which the divine properties ſo become the properties of the humane nature, that the humane nature may work with them, no leſs than the Divine nature it ſelf, for the perfecting of it ſelf. Againſt this opinion we have theſe Reaſons; 1. The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot cauſe the humane nature to partake more in the properties of the Divine, than it cauſeth the Divine to partake in the properties of the humane. 2. If a true and real communication did follow of the Divine Attributes, it muſt needs be of all the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, as of eternity, and infiniteneſs ſeeing theſe are the Divine Eſſence, which can no way be divided. 3. Infinite perfections cannot perfect finate natures, no more than reaſonable perfections can make perfect unreaſonable creatures. 4. To what end ſhould created gifts ſerve, which Chriſt hath received above meaſure, if now more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble properties ſhould enter and be conferred on Jeſus <hi>Chriſt?</hi> other reaſons are given in, but I willingly decline all controverſal points.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. On Chriſt's part, that He might receive power and dominion over all the creatures:<note place="margin">Math. 28.18.</note> 
                     <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;</hi> he ſpeaks of it as done, becauſe it was immediatly to be performed; <hi>Chriſt</hi> at his Seſſion received a

Oh what Power hath Chriſt himſelf this way? and as for the excellencies on earth, they all receive their power from Chriſt, and are at his diſpoſe; it is Jeſus Chriſt that is <hi>Crowned with Glory and Honour, and all things are put under his feet.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 27.8.</note> And hence it is that when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Chriſts ſeſſion at the right hand of God, he tells us, he is <hi>far above all Principalities and Powers</hi> on earth,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.21.</note> 
                     <hi>and Mights and Dominions</hi> in Heaven: yea, <hi>that Angels and Authorities,</hi>

                     <hi>and Powers are made ſubject unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. On our part many reaſons may be given. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he might be the Head of his Church, I mean, not head in a large ſenſe, for one who is in any kind before another; for ſo Chriſt is the head of Angels, and God is the head of Chriſt; and to this we have ſpoken before. But in a ſtrict ſenſe, for one that is in a near and communicative ſort conjoyned with another, as the Head is conjoyned with the Body and Members; and ſo is Chriſt the head of his Church. Look as the King hath a more intimate and amiable Superiority over the Queen then over any other of his Subjects; ſo is it here in Chriſt our King, he is more amiably tempered, and more nearly affected to his Spouſe and Queen, the Church of God, then to any other whomſoever. And to this purpoſe he ſits at Gods right hand, that having now fulneſs of Grace and Glory in himſelf, he might be ready to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſame to his Church who are as the members of his body, that he might give them Grace here, and Glory hereafter; when he ſhall deliver up his Kingdom to his Father, and be all in all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he might be the object of divine adoration, then eſpecially it was ſaid and accompliſhed, <hi>Let all the Angels of God Worſhip him:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and let all men Honour the Son as they Honour the Father.</hi> After Chriſt's Seſſion,<note place="margin">John 5 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Stephen</hi> looken up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſaw the Glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding on the right hand of God, and then he Worſhipped; and <hi>called upon God ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi> It is true,<note place="margin">Acts 7.59.</note> that the ground of this divine adoration is the Union of the two natures of Chriſt, and therefore the <hi>Magi</hi> worſhipped him at his Birth, and as ſoon as ever he came <hi>into the World the Angels of</hi> God <hi>Worſhipped him;</hi> but becauſe by his Seſſion at God's right hand, the Divine Nature was manifeſted,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.</note> and the Humane Nature was exalted to that dignity and glory which it never had before, therefore now eſpecially, and from this time was the honour and dignity of Worſhip communicated to him as God and man. And hence Divines uſually make this one ingredient of Chriſt's ſitting at the right hand of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt, God, and Man, is the object of Divine adoration. <hi>O it is a great thing, and admirable, and full of wonder, that the man Chriſt ſhould ſit above at</hi> God<hi>'s right hand, and be adored of Angels and Archangels.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chry. Hom. <hi>5:</hi> in Heb.</note> Before this was the grace of Union conferred on Jeſus, and ſo he was adored before he ſuffered; but after he <hi>had humbled himſelf, and was made obedient unto death, even to the death of the Croſs, then (yea and therefore)</hi> God <hi>highly exalted him and gave him a Name,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>which is above every Name, that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhall bow, of things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth, and that every tongue ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Jeſus is Lord to the glory of</hi> God <hi>the Father.</hi> He was Lord before, in that he is the Son of God, but now he is Lord again by vertue of his humiliation and Seſſion at God's right hand. Trouble not your ſelves with their objection who ſay, That if adoration be due to Chriſt as God and man, that then the humane nature is to be adored: the Perſon adored is man, but the humanity it ſelf is not the proper object of that Worſhip. There is a difference betwixt the concrete and the abſtract; though the man Chriſt be God, yet his manhood is not God, and by conſequence not to be worſhipped with that worſhip which is properly and eſſentially Divine. Certainly, if adoration agree to the humanity of Chriſt, then may his humanity help and ſave us; but the humanity of Chriſt cannot help and Save us, becauſe <hi>omnis actio eſt ſuppoſiti,</hi> whereas the humane nature of Chriſt is not <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> a ſubſiſtance or perſonal being at all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he might intercede for his Saints.<note place="margin">Heb. 8.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Now of the things which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, this is the Summe; we have ſuch an high Prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens, and a Miniſter of the ſanctuary, and of the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:94897:205"/> true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not men:</hi> he is ſet on the right hand of God as an high Prieſt, or Miniſter to intercede for us. <hi>For as Chriſt is not entred into the holy Place made with hands which are the Figures of the true,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9.24.</note> 
                     <hi>but into Heaven it ſelf now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> This <hi>appearing</hi> is an expreſſion borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the cuſtome of human Courts; for as in them, when the Plaintiff or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is called, their Attorney appeareth in their names, ſo when we are ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the juſtice of God to anſwer the complaints which it preferreth againſt us, <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 2.1. Exod. 28.9, 10 11, 12.</note> and he ſtandeth up, and appeareth for us: or it may be this <hi>appearing</hi> hath a reſpect to the manner of high Prieſts in the time of the Law; for as they uſed to go into the moſt holy place with the names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> written in precious ſtones, for a remembrance of them, that they might remember them to God in their Prayers; ſo Jeſus Chriſt being gone up to Heaven, he there preſents to his Father, the Names of all his choſen, and he remembers them to his Father in his Interceſſions. Certainly, Chriſt is not gone to Heaven, and advanced to the right hand of God, only to live in eternal joy himſelf, but alſo to procure happineſs for his Saints: it is to excellent purpoſe, and to the great good of his Church that he ſits at the right hand of his Father, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he governs and protects his people, and he continually executes the Office of his Prieſthood, preſenting himſelf, and the ſacrifice of himſelf, and the infinite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that ſacrifice before the eyes of his Father in their behalf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That true Believers may aſſuredly hope by vertue of Chriſts Seſſion to ſit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Kingdom of Glory.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.5.</note> It is true that Chriſt, and only Chriſt hath his ſeat at the right hand of God; <hi>to which</hi> of the Saints, or <hi>of the Angels did he ever ſay, ſit thou at my right hand?</hi> It is a prerogative above all Creatures; and yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near it given to the Saints,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.21.</note> 
                     <hi>for him that overcometh, I will grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> There is a proportion, though with an inequality; we muſt ſit on Chriſt's Throne, as he ſits on his Fathers Throne; Chriſt only ſits at the right hand of God, but the Saints are to ſit at the right hand of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.9.</note> and ſo the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>upon thy right hand did ſtand the Queen in Gold of Ophir.</hi> It is enough to greaten the Spirits of Saints; how ſhould they tread on earth, and contemn the World, when they conſider that one day they ſhall judg the World?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.2.</note> 
                     <hi>do you not know, that the Saints ſhall judg the World?</hi> nay,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.12</note> when they conſider that one day they ſhall reign with Chriſt? <hi>if ye ſuffer with him, ye ſhall reign with him.</hi> Chriſt ſitting in Heaven is a very Figure of us; Chriſt's perſon is the great model and firſt draught of all that ſhall be done to his Body the Saints; therefore he is ſaid to be the Captain of our Salvation that leads us on, he is ſaid to be our fore-runner into Glory; he breaks the clouds firſt, he appears firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, he ſits down firſt, and is glorified firſt, and then we follow; Chriſt wears the Crown in Heaven as our King, and he is united and marryed to God as our proxy.</p>
                  <p>And yet there is another ground of hope; not only ſhall we ſit with Chriſt in Glory, but even now do we ſit with him in Glory: Chriſt is not only gone to heaven to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for us, but he ſits in Heaven in our room, and God looks on him as the great picture of all that body whereof he is Head, and he delights himſelf in ſeeing them all Glorified as in his Son. To this purpoſe the Saints are ſaid to ſit down with Chriſt at very preſent,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.6.</note> 
                     <hi>he hath made us to ſit together with him in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Chriſt in our nature is now exalted: this is that admirable thing which carried up <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> into an extaſie, that the ſame nature of which God ſaid <hi>duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return, ſhould now ſit in Heaven at God's right hand:</hi> but not only the human nature, but Chriſt in perſon ſits there, as a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in our ſtead; he is in his Throne, and we ſit with him in ſuperceleſtial places. O what ſtructures and pillars of hope are raiſed up here?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That he might defend the Church againſt her enemies; and at laſt deſtroy all the enemies of the Church. Such is the power of Chriſts Seſſion, that by it he holds up his Saints in the midſt of their enemies, ſo that the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt them; true indeed, that many times they are uſed as Lambs amongſt Wolves, but ſo Chriſt orders that the blood of Martyrs ſhould be the Seed of the Church; hereby his Church like a tree ſettles the faſter, and like a Torch ſhines the brighter for the ſhaking. And as for the enemies of his Church, there is a day of reckoning for them, <hi>he that ſitteth in the Heavens ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.</hi> The
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94897:205"/> day is a coming that <hi>he will ſpeak unto them in his wrath, and vex him in his ſore diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.4, 5.</note> In the mean while Chriſt is galling and tormenting them by the Scepter of his Word, and at laſt he will put them all under his feet. <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, until I make my enemies thy foot-ſtool.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.1. 1 Cor. 15.25.</note>—<hi>For he muſt reign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet:</hi> that the enemies of Chriſt muſt be made his foot-ſtool notes the extream ſhame and confuſion which they ſhall everlaſtingly ſuffer: in victories amongſt men the party conquered goes many times off upon ſome honourable terms, or at worſt if they are led captive they go like men; but to be made a ſtool for the conqueror to inſult over, this is extremity of ſhame; and as ſhame, ſo it notes burthen which the wicked muſt bear; the foot-ſtool bears the weight of the body, ſo muſt the enemies of Chriſt bear the weight of his heavy and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath; ſuch a weight ſhall they bear that they would gladly exchange it for the weight of rocks and mountains, rather would they live under the weight of the heavieſt creature in the world, then under the fury of him that ſitteth upon the Throne. And withal it notes an equal and juſt recompence to the wicked; the Lord uſeth often to fit puniſhments to the quality and meaſure of their ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he that on earth denyed a crumb of bread, was in hell denyed a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and thus will Chriſt deal with his enemies at the laſt day; here they trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt in his Word, in his ways, in his members;<note place="margin">Iſa. 51.23.

What was the meaning of this, but to hold harmony, and to keep correſpondency with thoſe memorable things? as on the day of Pentecoſt (fifty days after the feaſt of the Paſſeover) the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came to mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> there received they the Law; a memorable day with them, and therefore called the feaſt of the Law; ſo the very ſame day is accompliſhed that propheſie, <hi>Out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem;</hi>

There were many uſes of this feaſt; 1. For the general releaſe of Servants. 2. For the reſtoring of Lands unto their firſt owners who had ſold them. 3. For the keeping of a right chronology, and reckoning of times; for as the Greeks did reckon by their Olimpiads, and the Latine, by their Luſtra, ſo did the <hi>Hebrews</hi> by their Jubilees; this falls fit with the proclaiming of the Goſpel, which is an act or tender of Gods moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious general free pardon of all ſins, and of all the ſinners in the World; now was the ſound of the Goſpel made known unto all,<note place="margin">Acts 2.5.</note>

We may learn to receive thoſe holy motions of the ſpirit, which ſometimes come ſuddenly, and we know not how; I am perſwaded the man breathes not amongſt us Chriſtians, that ſometimes feels not the ſtirrings, movings, breathings of the ſpirit of God; Oh that men would take heed of deſpiſing preſent motions! Oh that men would take the wind while it blows, and the water while the Angel moves it; as not knowing when it will, or whether ever it will blow again!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He came <hi>from heaven;</hi> the place ſeems here to commend the gift; as from earth earthly things ariſe, ſo from heaven heavenly, ſpiritual, eternal things. And this is one ſign to diſtinguiſh the ſpirits: <hi>Beloved, believe not every ſpirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 4.1.</note> 
                     <hi>but try the ſpirits whether they are of God.</hi> If our motions come from heaven, if we fetch our grounds thence, from heaven, from Religion, from the ſanctuary, it is the ſpirit of God; or if it carry us heaven-ward, if it make us heavenly minded, if it wean us from the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:94897:207"/> world, and if it elevate and ſet our affections on heavenly things, if it form and frame our converſations towards heaven, we may then conclude the motions are not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but from above. O that Chriſtians would be much in obſervation of, and in liſtning to the movings, workings, hints, and intimations of that Spirit that comes from heaven. Certainly that Spirit is of God that comes down from heaven, and that lifts up our Souls towards heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He comes down from heaven like a wind; The compariſon is moſt apt; of all bodily things the wind is leaſt bodily; it is inviſible, and comes neareſt to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Spirit: it is quick and active as the Spirit is. But more eſpecially the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is compared to a wind in reſpect of its irreſiſtable workings; as nothing can reſiſt the wind, it goes and blows which way ſoever it will; ſo nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Spirit of God, whereſoever it hath a purpoſe to work efficaciouſly; I will not ſay, but the heart of a man may reſiſt and reject the work of the Spirit in ſome meaſure,<note place="margin">Act. 7.51. 2 Cor. 10.5.</note> and in ſome degrees; <hi>Stephen</hi> told the <hi>Jews, they had always reſiſted the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt;</hi> and the Apoſtle tells of <hi>ſtrong holds, and of every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt God;</hi> ſo there is a natural contrariety, a conſtant enmity, and active re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Gods Spirit by our ſpirits; we muſt therefore diſtinguiſh between a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and a gradual reſiſting; the ſpirit in converſion ſo works, that he takes away the prevalent, but not the gradual reſiſting; A man before he be converted is froward, and full of cavils and prejudices, he is unwilling to be ſaved, he cannot abide the truth, he doth what he can to ſtifle all good motions: yet if he belong to the election of grace, God will at laſt over-maſter his heart, and make him; of unwilling, willing; he will omnipotently bow and change the will, and work on his ſoul by his mighty power efficaciouſly, inſuperably, and irreſiſtably. Again, the holy Ghoſt is compared to wind,<note place="margin">John 3.8.</note> in reſpect of its free actings; <hi>the wind bloweth where it liſteth</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) and ſo the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth; who can give any reaſon why the Spirit breathes ſo ſweetly on <hi>Jacob,</hi> and not on <hi>Eſau?</hi> on <hi>Peter,</hi> and not on <hi>Judas?</hi> is it not the free grace and good pleaſure of God? ſprings it not from the meer freedom and pure arbitrarineſs of his own only workings? <hi>to you it is given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of heaven</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but to them it is not given.</hi>

The Spirit blows where it liſteth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He came like <hi>a ruſhy mighty wind;</hi> as the wind is ſometimes of that ſtrength that it rends and rives in ſunder Mountains and Rocks, it pulls up trees, it blows down buildings; ſo are the operations of the holy Spirit; it takes down all before it, it brings into captivity many an exalting thought; it made a Conqueſt of the World, beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſpreading it ſelf over all the earth; it is mighty in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, able to ſhake the ſtouteſt and the proudeſt man, and to break in pieces the very ſtonieſt heart; indeed our words without this ſpirit are but weak wind, we may ſpend our ſelves, and never waken Souls; but if the Spirit blow, he will amaze the conſciences of the ſtouteſt peers, and drive away our ſins, as the wind drove away the Graſhoppers and Locuſts that over-ſpread the land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Some Analogy there is betwixt this vehement wind, and the ſpirits workings; the ſpirit firſt comes as a ſpirit of bondage, and then as a ſpirit of Adoption; the ſpirit of bondage is as a vehement wind that terrifies, to ſhew that we are not fit to receive the grace of God, unleſs the door be firſt opened by fear and humiliation; others ſay that the vehement ruſhing of this wind ſhewed how irreſiſtably the Apoſtles ſhould proceed in preaching the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; they had a Commiſſion to go into all the World, and to teach all Nations, and they had a promiſe that though many might oppoſe, yet the gates of hell ſhould not prevail againſt the Church; the ſpirit ſhould go along with them, and he in them, and they in him, ſhould prevail mightily like a ruſhing migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He filled all the houſe where they were ſitting; there were none there that were to filled with the holy Ghoſt; this room contained a congregation of none but Saints. All the men and women (an hundred and twenty, as ſome think) in this room were
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:94897:207"/> viſited from on high; for the holy Ghoſt came upon them, and dwelt in them; well might <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, I had rather be a door-keeper in the houſe of my God, then to dwell in the Tents of wickedneſs.</hi> They that abode in this houſe were under a promiſe that the Spirit ſhould come, and now was the promiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; for <hi>it filled all the houſe where they were ſitting.</hi> I ſay <hi>where they were ſitting,</hi> to ſignifie, that all the other houſes in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> felt none of this mighty ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind: there was no aſſembly of Saints in any part of the City, but only in this houſe; or if any other aſſembly might be, this Spirit blew upon none of them where theſe men were not; that, and only that houſe is filled, <hi>where they were ſitting.</hi> And this point of blowing upon one certain place is a property very ſuitable to the Spirit of God; <hi>the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>but canſt not tell whence it cometh, nor whether it goeth; ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit blows where it will, and upon whom it will, and they ſhall plainly feel it, and others about them not one jot: have we not ſometimes the experiences of this in our very congregations? one ſound is heard, one breath doth blow, and it may be one or two, and no more hears the ſound, or feels the breath inwardly, ſavingly; it may be one here, and another there ſhall feel the Spirit, ſhall be affected and touched with it ſenſibly; but twenty on this ſide them, and forty on that ſide them ſit all becalmed, and go their way no more moved, than when they came into Gods preſence. Oh that this Spirit of the Lord would come daily and conſtantly into our congregations! Oh that it would blow through them, and through them! O that it would fill every ſoul in the aſſembly with the breath of heaven! <hi>come holy Spirit? awake O North-Wind,</hi>

                     <hi>and come thou South-Wind, and blow upon our Gardens, that the ſpices thereof may flow out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He came down in the form of Tongues. As one ſaith well, <hi>This Wind brought Tongues, even a whole ſhowre of Tongues.</hi> The Apoſtles were not only inſpired for their now benefit, but they had gifts beſtowed on them to impart the benefit to more their themſelves. But why did the holy Ghoſt appear like Tongues? I anſwer, 1. The Tongue is a ſymbole of the holy Ghoſts proceeding from the Word of the Father; as the Tongue hath the neareſt affinity with the word, and is moved by the word of the heart, to expreſs the ſame by the ſound of the voice; ſo the holy Ghoſt hath the neareſt affinity that may be with the Word of God, and is the expreſſer of his voice, and the ſpeaker of his will. 2. The Tongue is the ſole inſtrument of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which conveighs the ſame from man to man; though the Soul be the Fountain from whence all wiſdom ſprings, yet the Tongue is the Channel and the conduit-pipe whereby this Wiſdom and Knowledge is communicated and Tansferred from man to man: in like manner the holy Ghoſt is the ſole Author and Teacher of all Truth; though Chriſt be the Wiſdom of God, yet the holy Ghoſt is the Teacher of this Wiſdom to men; And hence it is that the holy Ghoſt appeared in the form of Tongues.</p>
                  <p>And yet not meerly in the form of Tongues, but thus qualified. 1. They were <hi>Cloven Tongues;</hi> to ſignifie that the Apoſtles ſhould ſpeak in divers Languages; if there muſt be a calling of the Gentiles, they muſt needs have the Tongues of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles wherewith to call them; if they were <hi>debtors not only to the Jews,</hi>

They were <hi>fiery Tongues;</hi> to ſignifie that there ſhould be an efficacy, or fervour in their ſpeaking; the World was ſo over-whelmed with ignorance and errour, that the Apoſtles lips had need to be touched with a coal from the Altar; Tongues of fleſh would not ſerve the turn, nor words of air, but there muſt be fire put into the Tongue, and Spirit of life into the words they ſpeak; with ſuch a tongue Chriſt ſpeak him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when they ſaid of him, <hi>did not our hearts burn within us,</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. FOR the meaſure, what or how much of the Spirit was now given? this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neceſſary, becauſe we bring in the Spirits miſſion after Chriſt's aſcenſion, as if the holy Ghoſt had not been given before this time. That this was the time of the coming of the holy Ghoſt, is very plain; but that the holy Ghoſt was not given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, we cannot ſay; certainly the Prophets ſpeak by him, and the Apoſtles had him,<note place="margin">John 20.22.</note> not only when they were firſt called, but more fully when <hi>he breathed on them, and ſaid unto them, receive yea the holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that if ye ſtudy the reconciliation of theſe things, I know not any way better than to put it on the meaſure, or degrees of the Spirits miſſion.—I know ſome go about to reconcile it thus, that the holy Ghoſt was given before ſecretly with grace, but now he was given in a viſible ſhape with power. Others thus, that the holy Ghoſt was before given in reſpect of Grace and Miniſterial gifts, but now he was given in reſpect of vertue, or Ghoſtly ability to work Wonders, and to ſpeak with divers Languages. But we find that the Prophets and Apoſtles before this had not only Grace, and Miniſterial gifts, but a miraculous ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, even the Spirit of powerfull and extraordinary operation: only here was the difference, that before this, the Spirit was but ſprinkled (as it were) upon them, but now it was poured upon them; before this they were gently breathed on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with a ſmall gale, but now they were all blown upon with a mighty wind; without controverſie a difference there is in the Spirits miſſion; And that ſome lay down chiefly in theſe three things.—</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Another difference is in reſpect of the Subjects unto whom he was ſent; before now he came only upon the incloſed garden of the Jews, but after the aſſenſion of Chriſt, The Spirit was poured upon all fleſh; now every believer is of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, every Chriſtian is a Temple of the holy Ghoſt; now we receive the Spirit too, or elſe it is wrong with us; for <hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. One difference more is in the meaſure of his miſſion. At firſt he was ſent only in drops and dew, but now he was poured out in ſhowers and abundance; <hi>The holy Ghoſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) was ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus our Saviour.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3.6.</note> As there are degrees in the wind, <hi>aura, ventus, procella;</hi> a breath, a blaſt, a ſtiffe gale; ſo we cannot deny degrees in the Spirit, the Apoſtles at Chriſts reſurrection received the Spirit, but now they were filled with the Spirit; then it was but a breath, but now it was a mighty wind. And indeed never was the like meaſure of the Spirit given to men as at this time; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before this, and we and our Fathers ſince this, have but (as it were) a hint of the Spirit to their Epha; ſuch a pentecoſt as this, never was but this, never the like before or ſince; it was Chriſt's Coronation-day, the day of placing him in his throne, when he gave theſe gifts unto men, and therefore that day was all magnificence ſhewed above all other days; Thus for the meaſure of the Spirit now given to the Church of Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:94897:209"/> of all regenerate men. And this ſeems clear to me: 1. By Scriptures. 2. By Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scriptures are ſuch as theſe, <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture ſaith, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water; but this ſpake he of the Spirit,</hi>

                     <hi>which they that believe on him ſhould receive, for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified;</hi> for thoſe words, <hi>out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water;</hi> by <hi>living water,</hi> is meant grace; by <hi>rivers of living water,</hi> is meant the manifold graces of the Spirit; by <hi>the flowing of theſe rivers,</hi> is meant the abounding and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of thoſe graces from one to another; and by <hi>the belly out of which thoſe rivers ſhould flow,</hi> is meant the heart indued or filled with the Holy Ghoſt. Now the ſpring and rivers, the fountain and ſtreams are diverſe things, and to be diſtinguiſhed: the one is the cauſe, and the other the effect; the one is the tree, and the other the fruit; it is the holy Ghoſt filling the hearts of beleivers, that is the ſpring and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whence all thoſe rivers of living waters flow: And therefore ſaith the Evangeliſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>This ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe ſhould receive;</hi> of what Spirit? even, of <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which in full meaſure <hi>was not yet given, becauſe that Chriſt was not yet glorified;</hi> it is the ſame ſpirit which believers receive, whence <hi>all theſe rivers of living waters flow;</hi> but thoſe rivers flow not from habital grace, nor from any of the graces of the Holy Ghoſt, but from the Holy Ghoſt himſelf.</p>

                     <hi>If ſo be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.</hi> Here's a plain diſtinction betwixt the new man, our being in the Spirit, and the Spirit dwelling in us; <hi>Now if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, (i.e.)</hi> the ſame holy Spirit which dwelleth in our head and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he is none of his.—But if the ſpirit of him that raiſed Jeſus from the dead dwell in you,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Actions are aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt, as given unto us, or dwelling in us,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.8, 13. Rom. 8.15, 16</note> 
                     <hi>When the ſpirit is come, he will reprove the World of ſin.—And when the ſpirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.—And yea have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby ye cry, Abba Father:—And this ſpirit beareth witneſs with our ſpirits, that we are the Children of</hi> God. Theſe actions are uſually given to the Holy Ghoſt, I mean to that Holy Ghoſt which we receive, and dwelleth in us; it reproves, it guides, it helps, it ſatisfies, it witneſſeth; now, <hi>actiones ſunt ſuppoſitorum;</hi> actions are of perſons, and not of qualities; habitual grace cannot reprove, or guide, or teach, or help our infirmities: theſe are the actions of the Spirit himſelf, in his own perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſpirit it ſelf is the bond of our miſtical union with Jeſus Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the Spirit it ſelf that dwelleth in us. Look as it is in our body, there is head and members, yet all are but one natural body, becauſe they are animated and quickned by one and the ſelf-ſame ſoul; ſo it is in the miſtical body, Chriſt is our head, and we are his members, and yet both of us are but one myſtical body, by reaſon of the ſelf-ſame
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:94897:210"/> Spirit dwelling in both. And hence it is ſaid, that Chriſt dwelleth in us by his ſpirit;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.5. John 6.26.</note>

                     <hi>but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> How in me? not corporally, for in that ſenſe, <hi>The Heavens muſt receive him untill the time of the reſtitution of all things;</hi> but ſpiritually according to the teſtimony of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Acts 3.21.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe ye are ſons,</hi> God <hi>hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As Satan keeps his reſidence in wicked men, working them unto all manner of ſin, and holding them captive to do his will; ſo the ſpirit of God coming and thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out of poſſeſſion, dwelleth in us, leading us into all truth, repleniſhing us with all graces, and enclining us to all holy Obedience. There is little queſtion but whileſt men remain in the ſtate of infidelity, the ſtrong man <hi>Satan</hi> keeps poſſeſſion, and dwelleth in them, though not after a groſs, and ſinſible manner, as in Demoniacks; yet inviſibly and ſpiritually, ruling and reigning in them, and making them his ſlav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If the ſpirit it ſelf dwell not in us, then how would there be three that bear witneſs? the Apoſtle tells us,<note place="margin">1 John 5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>There are three that bear witneſs in earth</hi> (or in our hearts <hi>the Spirit, the water, and blood;</hi> now by <hi>water</hi> is meant ſanctification, it is our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that bears witneſs with us that we are the Children of God; and this ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication conſiſts either in the habit of grace, or in the actings of grace; if therefore the ſpirit of Chriſt in a believer were nothing elſe but grace, then it were all one with the teſtimony of water; but there are three that bear witneſs, there's the teſtimony of <hi>the ſpirit, of blood, and of water;</hi> not only juſtification, and ſanctification, which are but two witneſſes, but the ſpirit is ſuperadded, and that alſo bears witneſs in our Conſciences, that we are the Children of God, and that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God. Chriſtians! think me not tedious in theſe proofs; theſe are not ſpeculative notional poynts, that tend not to edification, but are exceeding profitable. Only concerning the manner of the indwelling of this ſpirit in us, it is moſt difficult to conceive. Certainly it dwells not in us as in Chriſt, <hi>viz. bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. <hi>unmeaſurably,</hi> Joh. 3.34. <hi>Originally,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17. the ſpirit is in Chriſt, as light in the ſun; but the ſpirit is in us as light in the air;<note place="margin">In Chriſto ut lux in ſole, in nobis ut lumen, in aere. <hi>Ezek. 36.27. — 37.14.</hi>
                     </note> neither dare I affirm, that the ſpirit is in us more eſſentially than in any other men or creatures, for the eſſence thereof is indiviſible and omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: But this I ſay, that the ſpirit is in the faithful above all others. 1. In reſpect of Covenant, the Saints have the ſpirit by God's free Grace and Covenant; <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you,</hi> ſaith God in the Covenant, which is not only to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the gifts and graces of the ſpirit, but alſo of the ſpirit it ſelf. 2. In reſpect of intimate familiarity, and near acquaintance, the ſpirit is in the faithful like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or coinhabitant, comforting, directing, ruling, ſtrengthning, and cheriſhing them; in which reſpect they are ſaid to be his houſes, and Temples, in which he dwelleth; whereas contrariwiſe worldlings and infidels to all theſe purpoſes are meer ſtrangers unto him, <hi>the world cannot receive him</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.17.</note> 
                     <hi>but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> 3. In reſpect of vertue and efficacy; the ſpirit works efficaciouſly in his Saints; he chooſeth them for his own people, he poſſeſſeth them as of his own right, he rules in their hearts as in the chief ſeat of his Kingdom, he purgeth and purifieth them from their ſins, he repleniſheth and filleth them with his ſaving graces, he guides and directs them in the way of holineſs, and never leaves them till he brings them to his Kingdom. 4. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of union; it was an old errour of the heathens, that the ſoul remaineth in the body after Death; which opinion of theirs, though falſe, becauſe it contradicts the Word, yet the thing it ſelf is poſſible, and doth not contradict reaſon; for the ſoul may have its local being in the body, and yet not give life to the body; for it is not the ſouls being in the body, but its being united to the body which makes the body live; ſo it is not the Spirits being locally with the ſoul, but being myſtically united to the ſoul that gives it ſpiritual life. Now in all theſe reſpects, the ſpirit is in the faithful above all others.</p>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:94897:210"/>
                  <p>I know the objections, As 1. If the Spirit be united to a believers ſoul, and ſo made one with him, then may a believer ſay, <hi>I am the ſpirit;</hi> or <hi>I am equal with</hi> God <hi>in reſpect of the ſpirit in me, though not as</hi> Peter, Thomas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I anſwer, this follows not; for though the ſpirit be really united to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſpirit, ſo that he may ſay with the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> or hath one ſpirit; yet firſt, this union is a voluntary act, and not a natural act; and in that reſpect the Spirit may unite himſelf to the ſoul ſo far as he pleaſeth, and no further: And certainly thus far he is not pleaſed to unite himſelf to a believer, as that a believer ſhould ſay properly, <hi>I am the Spirit;</hi> or <hi>I am equal with</hi> God <hi>in reſpect of the ſpirit;</hi> for then a believer might be worſhipped with Divine worſhip. 2. This union is by way of application, and not by way of mixture; if an heap of Wheat and a ſtone ſhould be joyned together, there is an union, they make both one heap; but the Wheat cannot ſay, <hi>I am a ſtone;</hi> nor can the ſtone ſay, <hi>I am wheat;</hi> becauſe this union is only by way of Application: but if Wine and Water ſhould be joyned together, then every part may ſay, <hi>I am Water,</hi> and <hi>I am Wine;</hi> becauſe this union is not only by application, but by way of mixture. Certainly there is a great union betwixt the Spirit and a believers ſoul, yet cannot the believer ſay properly, <hi>I am the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>I am equal with</hi> God, becauſe their union is only by way of application, and not by way of mixture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Object.</hi> No more was the union of Chriſt as God, with our nature as man, any union by way of mixture; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Our ſouls union with the ſpirit of Chriſt goes very far, and indeed ſo far as we cannot expreſs it, though we had the tongues, and heads, and hearts of men and Angels; yet comes it ſhort of that union betwixt the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, and the ſoul and body of Chriſt; his union was perſonal, but ſo is not ours: a believer is a perſon before he is united to the ſpirit of Chriſt; but now Chriſt's ſoul and body were not a perſon before united to the perſon of the Godhead. Go we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as far as we can, and I ſhall eaſily yeild that our union with the ſpirit is a true, real, eſſential, ſubſtantial, ſpiritual, inviſible, myſtical, intimate union, yet is it not a perſonal, or hypoſtatical union; the ſpirit doth not aſſume the ſoul or body of a believer, as the ſecond perſon aſſumed the ſoul and body of Chriſt. Away, away with theſe cavils and blaſphemies, wherewith too many unſtable ſouls are now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected! I have done with this Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the holy Ghoſt might according to his Office, endow men with gifts: no ſooner he beſtows his perſon, but immediatly he fills us with his train.</p>
                  <p>Now the gifts of the Spirit are of theſe two ſorts, ſome are common to good and bad, others are proper to the Elect only. Thoſe gifts which are common, are again two-fold; for ſome of them are given but to certain men, and at certain times; as the gift of Miracles, of Tongues, of Propheſies, and theſe were neceſſary for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and the Primitive Church, when the Goſpel was firſt to be diſperſed; others are given to all the members of the Church, and at all times, as the gifts of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, Sciences, Arts, Prudence, Learning, Knowledg, Eloquence, and ſuch like; the former gifts we have not, but theſe latter are now given to every member of the Church, according to the meaſure of Chriſt's gift, as the calling and vocation of every member needeth. As for thoſe gifts and ſaving graces which are proper to the godly, I ſhall ſpeak of them anon. Now here is another reaſon of the ſpirits miſſion,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.8.</note> 
                     <hi>that he might give gifts unto men;</hi> if you ask, what are thoſe gifts? the Apoſtle tells you in one place, <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts,</hi>

The Spirit doth not only diſcover, but heal the corruptions of the ſoul, and there is no comfort, to the comfort of a ſaved and cured man; the lame man that was reſtored by <hi>Peter,</hi> expreſſed the abundant exaltation of his heart, by leaping and praiſing God, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.8. and for this cauſe the Spirit is called <hi>the Oyl of gladneſs,</hi> becauſe by that healing vertue that is in him he makes glad the hearts of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirit doth not only heal, but renew and revive again; when an eye is ſmitten with a ſword, there is a double miſchief, a wound made, and a faculty periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and here, though a Chirurgeon can heal the wound, yet he can never reſtore the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, becauſe total privations admit no regreſs, or recovery. But the ſpirit doth not only heal, and repair, but renew and re-edifie the ſpirits of men; as he healeth that which was torn, and bindeth up that which was broken, ſo he reviveth and raiſeth up that which was dead before, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1.2. And this the Apoſtle calls, <hi>the renovation of the Spirit,</hi> Tit. 3.5. Now this renovation muſt needs be matter of great joy, for ſo the Lord comforts his afflicted people; <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 54.11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; behold, I will lay thy ſtones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyres, and I will make thy windows of Agates; and thy gates of Carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleaſant ſtones.</hi> The meaning is, that all muſt be new, and new built up as for a goodly, coſtly, and ſtately ſtructure.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſpirit doth not only renew, and ſet the frame of the heart aright, and then leave it to it ſelf, but being thus reſtored he abideth with it to preſerve and ſupport it, and to make it victorious againſt all tempeſts and batteries; and this further multiplyeth the joy and comfort of the heart; victory is ever the ground of joy,<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.3.</note> 
                     <hi>They joy before thee,—as men rejoyce when they divide the ſpoyle.</hi> And the ſpirit of God is a victorious ſpirit. <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench,</hi>

                     <hi>till he ſend forth judgment unto victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſpirit doth not only preſerve the heart which he hath renewed, but he makes it fruitfull and abundant in the work of the Lord. And fruitfulneſs is a ground of comfort, <hi>Sing O barren, thou that didſt not bear, break forth into ſinging,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 54.1.</note>

The Spirit doth not only make the heart fruitful, but gives it the hanſel and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of its inheritance, and thereby it begets a lively hope, an earneſt expectation, a confident attendance upon the promiſes, and an unſpeakable peace and comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.

There is a work of ſanctifying grace upon the heart, and this is a ſeal of the Spirit alſo;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note> for whom the Spirit ſanctifieth, he ſaveth. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, ay, but how ſhould we know it? why, by this ſeal; as it follows, <hi>Let every one that Nameth the Name of the Lord depart from iniquity;</hi> none are children of God by adoption, but thoſe that are Children alſo by regeneration; none are heirs of Heaven,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.3, 4.</note> but they are new born to it; <hi>Bleſſed be God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who hath begotten us anew—to an inheritance immortal.</hi> This ſeal of ſanctification leaves upon the ſoul the likeneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, even grace for grace.</p>

                     <hi>The ſpirit blows how it liſteth;</hi> ſometimes he fills the ſoul with fuller gales, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again ſhe is becalmed; a man hath more of the Spirit at one time than another: now when the Spirit comes in thus by exciting, quickning, ſtirring, and inabling us to act; ſo that we can ſay,<note place="margin">Jer. 20.9.</note> as ſometime the Prophet ſaid, <hi>It was in my heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and could not ſtay;</hi> why then the ſpirit ſeals, and gives aſſurance to our ſouls that we are his.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a work of ſhining upon, or inlightning thoſe graces which the Spirit plants in us, and helps us to exerciſe; this ſeals to the purpoſe; and of this it is that the Apoſtle ſpeaks.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>We have received not the ſpirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> The things given to us may be freely received by us, and yet the receit of them not known to us; therefore the ſpirit for our further conſolation doth (as it were) put his hand and ſeal to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; he ſhines upon our graces, or he enlightens our graces, whereby we may know we believe, and know that we live. Indeed this is rare with Gods own People, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (notwithſtanding this ſeal) we may be in ſuch a ſtate as <hi>Paul</hi> and his company were in the ſhip,<note place="margin">Acts 27.20.</note> 
                     <hi>When they ſaw neither Sun nor Star for many days together;</hi> ſo it may be that for a time we may ſee neither Sun nor Star, neither light in God's countenance; nor light in our ſouls; no grace iſſuing from God, no grace carrying the ſoul to God; yet in this dark condition, if we do as <hi>Paul</hi> and his company did <hi>(i.e.)</hi> if we caſt anchor even in the dark night of temptation, and pray ſtill for day, God will appear, and all ſhall clear up; we ſhall at laſt ſee light without, and ſee light within, ſurely the day-ſtar will ariſe in our hearts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is a work of joy and comfort; and this is a ſuper-added ſeal of the Spirit; the works of the ſpirit you may ſee are of a double kind; either in us by imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſanctifying grace, or upon us by ſhining on our ſouls, and by ſweet feeling of joy; habitual grace, or ſanctifying grace is more conſtant, and alwayes like it ſelf; but
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:94897:212"/> this work of comfort and joy is of the nature of ſuch priviledges as God vouchſafeth at one time and not at another; and hence it is that a Chriſtian may have grace and a Chriſtian may know himſelf to be in the ſtate of grace, and yet in regard of comfort God may be gone. Thus it was with <hi>Job,</hi> he knew his redeemer lived, and he reſolved to truſt in him though he killed him; he knew he was no hypocrite, he knew his graces were true; notwithſtanding all the objections and imputations of his friends, they could not diſpute him out of his ſincerity, <hi>My righteouſneſs I hold faſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job. 27.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and will not let it go;</hi> yet for the preſent he ſaw no light from heaven, but he was in a ſore and afflicted condition, till it pleaſed the Lord to reveal himſelf in ſpecial favour unto him. Now this work of joy uſually comes not till after faith; and many experiences of Gods love, and much waiting upon God. Theſe are the ſeveral works of the ſpirits ſealing.</p>
                  <p>But why is it that we can neither actually believe, nor can know that we believe, nor can enjoy peace and joy in believing, without a freſh and new act of the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, becauſe the whole carriage of a ſoul to heaven is above nature, where the Spirit makes a ſtand, we ſtand, and can go no farther; without the help of the Spirit we can neither make promiſes, nor conclude for our ſelves; it is the ſpirit that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and witneſſes, and <hi>ſeals our ſouls unto the day of redemption.</hi> Many other Reaſons may be rendred, but I ſhall ſpeak of them in the end of the ſpirits miſſion.</p>
                  <q>Thus far we have propounded the object, <hi>viz.</hi> the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, the ſeſſion of Chriſt at God's right hand, and Chriſts miſſion of the holy Ghoſt; our next work is to direct you how to look unto Jeſus in theſe reſpects.</q>

The ſpirit of Chriſt is a witneſſing ſpirit. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit that we are the children of God:</hi> and <hi>every one that believeth hath the witneſs within himſelf.</hi> But of this two queſtions. 1. What is this witneſſing work of the ſpirit? 2. How doth the ſpirit thus witneſs? for the firſt, I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In general; witneſſing is a giving in ſome evidence upon our knowledge how the matter in queſtion ſtandeth, that thereby others may be aſcertained of the truth of the thing:<note place="margin">Deut. 19.15. John 8.17.</note> 
                     <hi>At the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall the matter be establiſhed;</hi> theſe words Chriſt cited, and ſaid, <hi>It is written in your Law, that the teſtimony of two men is true;</hi> not but that it was certain in it ſelf before, but that now by the teſtim ny of two it is rendred certain unto thoſe that queſtion the ſame; this is witneſſing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In ſpecial; The witneſſing of the ſpirit is an Office of the ſpirit, whereby it works the ſoul into a knowledge, perſwaſion, or concluſion of its acceptation into favour with God in Chriſt. Now the ſpirit witneſſeth either objectively, or efficiently.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Objectively; When it only affords ſuch ſpecial operations as have an aptitude to aſcertain the ſoul, but do not aſcertain, thus many a time the Spirit comes and brings in ſuch, and ſuch aſcertions or affirmations of our adoption, as if they were but duly obſerved, might manifeſt the ſame, but we over-look theſe evidences, we will not hear what the ſpirit ſpeaks to us;<note place="margin">John 3.11.</note> 
                     <hi>We ſpeak that we know</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and teſtifie that we have ſeen; but ye receive not our witneſs:</hi> ſo may the ſpirit complain, <hi>I have teſtified to you that which I know, I have ſaid that ye were children of God, but ye have not received my witneſs;</hi> doubtleſs it is a ſinful neglect not to yield attention unto the voyce of the ſpirit; and yet the ſpirit in this way may be reſiſted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Efficiently; and if the ſpirit witneſs thus, it cannot be reſiſted; in this way the ſpirit cauſeth the ſoul to conclude of its adoption by its ſpeakings to it: this is not onely the aſſertions or affirmations of our adoption, but the aſſurances of our ſouls that we are adopted.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.

                  <p n="2">2. How doth the Spirit thus witneſs? I anſwer, 1. Immediately. 2. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the immediate teſtimony of the Spirit there is ſome controverſie: Antinomians would have no other teſtimony but this; all other evidences (ſay they) are deceiving evidences; or if not deceiving, yet to make uſe of them it were but to light a candle to the Sun; for what are the graces of the Spirit in compariſon of the Spirits own teſtimony? and it may be the running into this extream hath cauſed others abſolutely to deny any ſuch teſtimony; or at leaſt to ſay <hi>for theſe enthuſiaſms or inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, let them boaſt of them that have them, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Rutherford</hi> on Joh. 12. <hi>P.</hi> 100.</note> to make the eye ſee lights and colours without; and as there is in the ear, <hi>aer internus,</hi> a certain in-bred found and air, to make it diſcern the ſounds that are without; ſo is there in a gracious heart, a new nature, an habitual inſtinct of Heaven to diſcern the conſolations of God's Spirit, immediately teſtifying that we are the Sons of God; there are ſome ſecret and unexpreſſible lineaments of the Fathers countenance in this child, that the renewed ſoul at firſt bluſh knows and owns it. But for fear of miſtakes, in this caſe obſerve we theſe Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That although the ſpirit may immediately teſtifie without any expreſs or formal application of a word, yet he never teſtifies but according to the Word. If a man that never felt ſin a burthen, that throws away all duties of Religion, that never Prayes, Reads, Hears, or Meditates, ſhall ſay that he is filled with joy, Peace, and, the aſſurance of God's Word, it is certain the holy Spirit is not the Author of this, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of peace belongs to none of this ſtamp; ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Mal.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ordinarily the ſpirit brings in his teſtimony either in duty, or after duty. <hi>I have ſeen his wayes, and I will heal him; I will lead him alſo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 57.18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>and reſtore comforts to him and to his mourners; I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, ſaith the Lord, and I will heal him.</hi> I know there may be a caſe of grievous temptations, and at ſuch a time the ſpirit of God may come in by a ſudden irradiation, and chear the ſoul wonderfully, though it knows not how; yet uſually the ſpirit brings in his teſtimony either in duty, or not long after duty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſuch teſtimonies of the Spirit beget only an actual aſſurance during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exigency, or in order to ſome preſent deſign that God is working thereby; theſe are extraordinary dainties, that God will not have us feed conſtantly upon; a gleam of light in a dark winters night, when a man cannot coaſt the Country, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his way by thoſe marks which direct him at other times; or as a lightning from a thunder-cloud, that comes juſt in the moment when a man is ſtepping into a pit that would ſwallow him up; now a Traveller will not depend alwayes upon ſuch guides, but rather he will chooſe to travel by day; and learn out ſuch way marks as may be ſtanding aſſurances to him that he is in the way. And therefore—</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſpirit witneſſeth mediately; and that either without, or with argumentation. But both from the Word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Without argumentation, and that is when the ſpirit applies ſome ſuitable word to the ſoul, and without more ado enables the ſoul to cloſe with that ſuitable word. As for inſtance, thou art burthened for ſin, and thou haſt prayed earneſtly
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:94897:218"/> for pardon of ſin, and even then a ſecret whiſper of the Spirit caſts that word into thy heart,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.4. Mat. 11.28.</note> 
                     <hi>I will heal thy back-ſlidings, and love thee freely,</hi> or ſuch a voice as that, <hi>come un-unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Now this is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect teſtimony; only I dare not leave it without a caution.—Some can relate extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary paſſages of providence attending the coming in of ſuch and ſuch a word: as that they did not know there was any ſuch Scripture, nor did thy know where it was and yet in opening the Book, it was the very firſt place their eye was caſt upon; or they wanted a Book, and in the uſe of ſome other means unexpectedly a word was ſpoken, or remembred, ſo pat to the caſe, as if it had been a very meſſage from Heaven: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Spirits hinting in of words thus, is very obſervable; yet a bare giving in of a word is no warrant that it comes from the ſpir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> unleſs the ſoul come up to ſome end which the word it ſelf poynteth at; there muſt not only be a word, but a cloſing with the word, and improving of the word, for the ends it aymeth at, as quickning, comforting, ſupporting, acting of ſome graces, or ſuch like; and by this we may know that the teſtimony is true, and proceeds from the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With argumentation, and that is when the Spirit brings in the teſtimony <hi>of blood and water;</hi> I may call it a teſtimony of <hi>Faith,</hi> and other <hi>graces</hi> of the Spirit written in our hearts, and brought out by the ſpirit in a way of argument, as thus—<hi>He that believeth, hath everlaſting life; but I believe,</hi> Ergo. The firſt propoſition is the Goſpel, and in this way it is the firſt work of the ſpirit to open our eyes, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thereof. The ſecond propoſition is <hi>thy caſe, or my caſe;</hi> and here the Spirit enlightens the ſoul to ſee it ſelf under that condition, <hi>but I believe.</hi> Indeed many times this is not ſo eaſily done, and therefore the ſpirit doth elicite and draw forth the ſoul to an aſſent by a further evidence of argument, <hi>True</hi> (ſayes the ſoul) <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves hath everlaſting life, but I am none of thoſe believers, and therefore what doth this promiſe concern ſuch an unbelieving wretch as I am?</hi> In this caſe now the Spirits work is longer, or ſhorter, even as he pleaſeth; if it will be no better, the Spirit is fain to produce ſome other proofs of Scripture, as evidence faith in the ſubject in whom it is; ſuch as <hi>purifying the heart, love to God, his wayes, his people,</hi> &amp;c. and poſſibly it goes further yet, and proves thoſe graces to be in the ſoul by further marks.—I know ſome object, if the ſpirit ſay, thou art a <hi>believer,</hi> becauſe thou haſt <hi>love,</hi> the ſoul may doubt ſtill whether it have <hi>love</hi> or no; and if the ſpirit ſay, thou haſt love becauſe thou <hi>delighteſt in God</hi>'s <hi>Commandments;</hi> the queſtion may be ſtill, whether that <hi>delight</hi> be ſincere, or counterfeit; pure, or mixed; and therefore ſay they, <hi>There can be no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man</hi>'s <hi>juſtification by his ſanctification; or of his ſanctification by the operation of particular graces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, it is true, that whiles I endeavour to diſcover theſe graces meerly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they may be ſtill ſubject to queſtion, and ſo they can make no firm aſſurance; but in the ſoul that is graciouſly aſſured this way, the Spirit of God reſts the heart upon an <hi>ultimum quod ſic:</hi> he convinceth the ſoul by that which is moſt viſible in him, and ſo ſtops the mouth of cavilling reaſon from perplexing the queſtion any more. Indeed it is a fine skill to know whether a true aſſurance be meerly rationall, or from the witneſs of the Spirit of God? whether it be wrought out of a man's own brain, or wrought into his heart by the Holy Ghoſt? now in ſome caſes we may diſcern it, as thus; the aſſurance that the Spirit gives, doth ſometime ſurpriſe a man unexpectedly, at unawares; as it may be in a Sermon, that he came accidentally unto; or in a Scripture, that I caſt a tranſient-glancing eye upon; but thus doth not reaſon. Again, The aſſurance that the ſpirit gives, maintains a ſoul in a way of reliance and dependance, when it ſees no reaſon why he ſhould do ſo; or it may be when he ſees a reaſon why it ſhould not be ſo; as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> in another caſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.18.</note> that <hi>he believed in hope againſt hope;</hi> faith told him there was hope that he ſhould be the Father of many Nations, when reaſon told him there was none. Again, The aſſurance that the ſpirit gives, is attended with an high eſteem of Prayer, Duties, Ordinances, and in the iſſue (which is the moſt principal ſure mark) it purifies the ſoul that hath it,<note place="margin">1 John 3.3.</note> 
                     <hi>He that hath this hope purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure;</hi> he is ever waſhing himſelf from ſin, and watching againſt ſin, and taking all poſſible care to keep himſelf pure and unſpotted in this preſent evil world, it keeps the ſoul humble, and lowly, it being impoſſible that ſuch a teſtimony of the ſpirit, and ſo intimate a converſe with God, and the light of his countenance ſhould not reflect low thoughts upon a man's ſelf concerning himſelf; ſuch a man cannot but ſay, <hi>Lord, what am I that thou haſt brought me hitherto? what? for ſuch a peeviſh, unbelieving,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:94897:218"/> impatient ſoul as mine is, to be carryed in thy arms, and cheered with thy ſmiles, and to enjoy the comforts of thy ſpirit? Oh what a wonderful, merciful gracious God have I?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet in all this I exclude not the Spirit in drawing a rational evidence from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; certainly the ſpirit helps in a general way, by making uſe of our reaſon, only it elevates and improves our reaſon to a further aſſurance by a ſupernatural aſſiſtance; as in Prayer, and in Preaching of the Word, there may be a common aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God; but there is another kind of praying and preaching by the Spirit, which the Scripture often ſpeaks of, and calls <hi>the ſpirit of ſupplication, and the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit;</hi> and that is not performed by a common or general, but by a ſpecial and particular aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God; ſo there is a two-fold influence of the Spirit in putting forth acts of aſſurance in the heart, even of a Godly and Sound Chriſtian; the very ſame man may act aſſurance ſometimes rationally, and ſometimes ſpiritually; in the former the ſpirit acts too, but in a common way, only in the latter, is the ſupernatural, ſpecial aſſiſtance, which peculiarly is ſaid to be <hi>the witneſs of the Spirit.</hi> I ſpeak not againſt rational evidences, only it concerns us to apply our ſelves to the Spirit to ſuperadd his teſtimony: O let us not ſo content our ſelves with ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evidences, but that we labour to elevate the evidence of reaſon into a teſtimony of the Holy Spirit of God. To wind up all I have ſaid—</p>
                  <p>O my ſoul, try now the hope of the ſpirits indwelling by theſe ſeveral ſigns; art thou enlightned ſavingly in the knowledg of God, and of Chriſt? art thou a Child of God, one of his adopted ſons for whom he hath reſerved the inheritance? haſt thou a ſpirit of Grace and Supplication? a ſpirit of Sanctification? a ſpirit of Love? art thou led by the ſpirit? doſt thou feel the drawings of thy ſoul in every duty to Jeſus Chriſt? doſt thou feel a liberty, or a delight in thy ſoul to walk in the way of his Commandments? doſt thou feel any ſtrength to come in againſt thy corruptions; doſt thou feel the ſpirits help to act in Goſpel-duties for Goſpel ends? haſt thou ever had the immediate teſtimony of the ſpirit? or if not ſo; haſt thou ever had the immediate teſtimony of the ſpirit without any argumentation? haſt thou unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly dipt and lighted on ſome places of ſcripture that hath ſatisfied thy ſoul as with marrow and fatneſs? or if not ſo neither, haſt thou the immediate teſtimony of the Spirit with argumentation? canſt thou argue thus, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved but I believe, therefore I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Or if any doubt be made of the aſſumption; canſt thou prove it by ſuch other graces as accompany faith, and are the fruits of faith? canſt thou ſay by the help of the ſpirit, and ſhinings of the ſpirit, that theſe, and theſe graces are in me, and have been acted by me; yea, <hi>I do love God and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is it not an high Favour that a King ſhould leave his Court, to give a poor priſoner in the Jayl a viſit? but will he take him with him to his own home, and bring him into his own preſence-chamber, and ſet him at his right hand in his throne? And ſo that Chriſt ſhould not only leave his Fathers throne, and give me a viſit, lying in the dark dungeon of unbelief; but that he ſhould take off the bolts, and ſet open the priſon doors, and take me up with him into Heaven, and there ſet me down at his right hand, and in the mean time give me the earneſt and pledge of my inheritance, by filling my ſoul with his own ſpirit; O what an admirable incredible thing is this? it was the laſt viſion of</hi> John <hi>which was ſo full of wonders.

Some directions, and 2. Some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For directions of Faith, obſerve theſe particulars. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith muſt directly go to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith muſt go to Chriſt as God in the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith muſt go to Chriſt as God in the Fleſh made under the Law.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith muſt go to Chriſt not only as made under the directive part of the Law by his life, but under the penal part of the Law by his death.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Faith muſt go to Chriſt not only as put to death in the Fleſh, but as quickned by the ſpirit; of all theſe before.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Faith muſt not only go to Chriſt as quickened by the ſpirit, but as going up into glory, as ſitting down at God's right hand, and as ſending the holy Ghoſt; Faith ſhould eye Chriſt as far as he goes; if he be aſcended, ſo ſhould faith; if he go into glory, and ſit down there, and act there for his people, ſo ſhould faith; and ſo ſhould we in a way of believing follow after him, and take a view of all his tranſactions where he is; we have heard before how faith ſhould go to Chriſt as dying, and as riſing again; but yet faith is low, while it doth not go within the vail, and ſee him in glory; it is not enough to have only a faith of Juſtification, but of Glorification. O come let us ſee Chriſt in Heaven, and we can have no leſs than a glorious ſaith! how many are there that never yet came to act ſaith in Chriſt as a glorified Chriſt? we are yet ſtill in the lower form; many of us take in no more of Chriſt than what was done on the croſs, or what ſome natural, and common reſemblances of him can hold forth; we ſeldom follow Chriſt into Heaven, to ſee what he is doing theſe for us. O my ſoul! and O my faith! mount up, and be on the wing: Chriſt is gone up to heaven, Chriſt is ſet down at God's right hand; Chriſt hath ſent down his holy ſpirit: to this purpoſe it was expedient that he ſhould go away, and now he is gone away, to do ſomething that remains to be done for thee in his Kingdom; he had ſtill ſome glorious piece to frame for thy ſalvation, and therefore he left this world and went to his Father, that he might act it in glory; and now he is inveſted with all the riches of Heaven, he hath all the keyes of Heaven and Hell, he hath all power to command, he hath received all the promiſe to himſelf, and all that he hath to do, it is to let out of himſelf again unto his Saints; he hath not only got his Fathers heart for them, but he hath got all his riches to beſtow upon them; when he came to Heaven, the Father bid him ſit down at his right hand, and take what he would, and beſtow what he would upon his Saints; and thereupon he gave gifts unto men, yea, he gave the gift of gifts, even the Holy Ghoſt himſelf. What? art not thou a partaker of this gift? O then <hi>Look up unto Jeſus</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all theſe actings, ſet him before thee: Chriſt in all theſe particulars is a right object for thy faith to act upon.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Faith in going to Chriſt, his aſcenſion, ſeſſion and miſſion of the holy ſpirit, it is principally to look to the purpoſe, intent, and deſign of Chriſt in each of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: Chriſt did nothing but he had an end, a meaning in it for our good; and here is the life of Faith, to eye the meaning of Chriſt in all his doings. Now the ends of Chriſt's aſcenſion, ſeſſion, and miſſion of his ſpirit were ſeveral; I ſhall inſtance onely in theſe few. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt aſcended that we might aſcend: look whatever God acted on Chriſt's perſon, that he did as in our behalf, and he means to act the ſame on us: was Chriſt crucified? ſo are we; is Chriſt riſen again, ſo are we riſen together with him: is Chriſt gone up into glory? ſo are we; Heaven is now opened and poſſeſſed by Jeſus Chriſt for us, and at laſt we ſhall aſcend even as he aſcended; Chriſt cannot be content with that glory he hath himſelf,<note place="margin">John 17.25.</note> until we be with him; <hi>Father I will, that thoſe alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold, or enjoy my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> Chriſt as our head is in glory, and ſo we are there already with him; and Chriſt as our advocate is in glory, and there he is pleading and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

O you dull hereticks. infidels, blaſphemers, that fill up my ears with your fooliſh ſophiſms, and trouble me with your diſputes againſt my Lord &amp; Redeemer! go to him that knows him only by the hearing of the ear, if you mean to prevail; but I have known him by the ſweet experiences of my ſoul; go to him that makes a Religion of his Opinions, and whoſe belief was never any deeper than his fancy, and whoſe piety never reached higher than to abſtinency, and tasks of formal duty; theſe you may poſſibly draw away from Chriſt. But do you think to do ſo by me? why, tell me how? with what weapons or arguments can you think to prevail? what? ſhall tribulation be the means? no, no; I have that promiſe in the hand of my faith, and that glory in the eye of my hope, that will bring me through all <hi>tribulations under Heaven:</hi> or ſhall <hi>diſtreſs</hi> do it? why, I will rather ſtick ſo much cloſer to him that will relieve me in <hi>diſtreſs</hi> and bring me to his reſt.

Or ſhall <hi>nakedneſs</hi> be the weapon? I had rather paſs naked out of this World to Heaven, than to be cloathed in purple, and to be ſtript of it at death, and to be caſt into hell; <hi>Adam</hi>'s innocent nakedneſs, and <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s rags were better than that Epicure's gay apparel.— Or ſhall <hi>famine</hi> be the meanes? why, man liveth not by bread alone; I had rather my body were famiſhed than my ſoul; I have meat to eat that ye know not of, even the bread of life, which who ſo eats ſhall live for ever. Or will you affright me from Chriſt by the <hi>ſword</hi> of violence?

                  <p>But I hear ſome object; If the witneſs in our ſelves be ſo full and convincing, then what need have we any more to make uſe of Scriptures, or Miniſters? why ſhould we leave an higher Teacher to go to a lower?</p>
                  <p>But I anſwer, 1. There is more than one thing wanting to enwiſe us to ſalvation; as firſt, an outward Word; and ſecondly, an outward Teacher; and thirdly, an inward Light: And accordingly God ſupplies this threefold want; the firſt, by giving us the Scripture; the ſecond, by giving us a Miniſtry, and other occaſional Teachers; the third, by giving us the illumination of the Spirit, to help us to ſee by the former means, and to make the Word and Miniſtry to us effectual. Now it were a mad thing for a man to ſay, I have eyes to read in a book, and therefore I have no need of the light of Candle, or of Sun; or I have eyes, and Sun, and therefore I have no need of the light in the Air, which cometh from the Sun; or I have the light both of the Eye, and Sun, and Air, and therefore I can read by it without a Book; or I have a Book, and therefore I can read it without a Teacher: certainly if a man would read, he muſt have all theſe, or more than one of theſe; ſo God hath appointed us three neceſſary means for our illumination and direction; the Word, the Miniſtry, and the Spirit; <hi>What God hath joyned, let no man ſeparate;</hi> if any will fooliſhly go, and ſet one of theſe againſt another, when God hath ſet them all together, and made them all neceſſary, aſſigning to each a ſeveral part in the work of our illumination, they may abuſe God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and go without the light, while they deſpiſe the neceſſary cauſes of it. God's
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:94897:221"/> evidences muſt not be ſeparated, much leſs muſt one be pleaded to the neglect of all the reſt; as the work within us is not the firſt teſtimony, but a ſecondary confirming teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſo doth it not make the firſt unneceſſary or void: beſides that, by the external teſtimony we muſt convince other men, which by the witneſs within us we cannot do. But this only by the way.</p>

What? Chriſt aſcended?

                     <hi>He was cloathed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle; his head and his hairs were white like wooll, as white as ſnow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine braſs, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the ſound of many waters; and he had in his right hand ſeven ſtars, and out of his mouth went a ſharp two edged ſword, and his countenance was at the Sun that ſhineth in his ſtrength;</hi> when <hi>John</hi> ſaw him thus, he ſwoons at his feet, but Chriſt for all his Glory holds his head in his ſwoon, <hi>ſaying, fear not, I am the firſt, and the laſt; I am he that liveth, and was dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen, and hath the Keys of hell and of death.</hi> A glorious Chriſt is good for ſwooning, dying ſinners, would ſinners but draw near, and come and ſee this King in the chariot of love, and come and ſee his beauty, the uncreated white and red in
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:94897:222"/> his ſweet countenance, he would certainly draw their ſouls unto him. Nay, ſay that all the damned in hell were brought up with their burning fiery chains to the utmoſt door of Heaven: could we ſtrike up a window, and let them look in, and behold the Throne, and the Lamb, and the Troops of glorified ſpirits cloathed in white, with Crowns of gold on their heads, and Palms in their hands, ſinging the eternal praiſes of their glorious King; oh how would they be ſweetned in their pain, and convinced of their fooliſh choice, and raviſhed with the fulneſs of thoſe joyes and pleaſures that are in Chriſt's face for evermore? ſurely much more may this glory of Chriſt warm thy heart; O my ſoul! what an happineſs were it to ſee the King on his Throne; to ſee the Lamb, the fair Tree of Life, the branches which cannot for the narrowneſs of the place have room to grow in, <hi>For the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him?</hi> What an happineſs were it to ſee love it ſelf, and to be warmed with the heat of immediate love that comes out of the precious heart and bowels of this princely and royal Standard-bearer? as yet thou canſt not, muſt not ſee theſe ſights, there's no ſeeing the King thus in his beauty till thou comeſt to glory; for then, and then only muſt thou ſee him face to face, and yet the Idea and Image of this glory is ſeen and may be ſeen of every true believing ſoul; enough may be ſeen by an eye of faith, to kindle in thine heart a flame of love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Oh who can think of the glory that is in this dainty delightful One, and not be ſwallowed up in love? Who can think of Chriſt's ſitting at God's right hand, and ſparkling in this glory round about, and caſting out beams of glory through Eaſt, and Weſt, and North, and South, through Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, and not love him with the whole heart, ſoul and might? I remember one dying, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome diſcourſe of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>ſpeak more of this, let me hear more of this; be not weary of telling his praiſe, I long to ſee him, how ſhould I but long to hear of him?</hi> Surely I cannot ſay too much of Jeſus Chriſt; in this bleſſed ſubject no man can poſſibly hyperbolize; had I the tongues of Men and Angels, I could never fully ſet forth Chriſt; it involves an eternal contradiction that the creature can ſee to the bottom of the Creator. Suppoſe all the ſands on the Sea-ſhore, all the Flowers, Herbs, Leaves, twigs of Trees in Woods and Forreſts, all the Stars of Heaven, were all rational creatures, and had they that wiſdom, and tongues of Angels to ſpeak of the lovelineſs, beauty, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and excellency of Chriſt, <hi>as gone to Heaven, and ſitting at the right hand of his Father,</hi> they would in all their expreſſions ſtay millions of miles on this ſide Jeſus Chriſt. O the lovelineſs, beauty, and glory of his Countenance! can I ſpeak, or you hear of ſuch a Chriſt? and are we not all in a burning love, in a ſeraphical love, or at leaſt in a conjugal love? O my heart! how is it thou art not love ſick? how is it thou doſt not charge the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the ſpouſe did,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>I charge you O daughters of Jeruſalem, if ye find my beloved that ye tell him, I am ſick of love?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For his bounty, no ſooner was he aſcended, and ſet down at God's right hand, but <hi>he gives gifts unto men;</hi> and he ſends down the holy Ghoſt. This was the Gift of gifts; I ſhall only weigh two Circumſtances in this Gift, either whereof both dignifies, and caſts a ſparkle of bounty from the Giver, into the heart of the Receiver to move him to love. As—</p>
                  <p>One Circumſtance is the greatneſs of the Giver; certainly the preheminence or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of any principle ennobleth and enhanceth the effect; a gift coming from a great Perſon carries ever a ſcent with it of a certain greatneſs, and reliſheth either of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, or ſuperiority, or nobility, or all. It is ſtoried of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, that in his wars being ever preſt with want of money, and ſo unable to remunerate the ſervices of divers Dutch Captains, and Nobles, whom he had entertained; he uſed after any great exploit performed by them, to call together his Nobles and Camp into ſuch a field, and there in the preſence of them all to take a Gold chain from about his own neck, and to put it about the neck of ſuch a Captain, or ſuch a Collonel, and ſo to embrace him and to give him thanks for his gallant ſervice: why, this they eſteemed a greater favour (being Circumſtanced by ſuch a Perſon, in ſuch a way) than if in very deed he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them a ſufficient pay, or remuneration. O they valued that Chain more than many buſhels of the like Gold; the very Perſon of the Emperour hanged at the Chain ſuch a precious Jewel, as in warlike conceits a million of Gold could not countervail. O my ſoul, if an Emperour thus gained the affections of men, how ſhouldſt thou but love Chriſt the great Emperour of Heaven and Earth:<note place="margin">Numb. 11 17.</note> it was he that gave thee his Spirit, it was he that <hi>took off the Spirit which is upon him,</hi> (ſo is the expreſſion of God to <hi>Moſes) and put it upon thee;</hi> and doth not the Perſon of Chriſt, the Dignity of Chriſt, inhance
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:94897:222"/> the value of the gift? as all gifts are ſigns of love, ſo the love of a great Perſonage, and the gifts iſſuing from ſuch a love, ought more to be accounted than any gifts of any meaner perſon whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Circumſtance is, the greatneſs of the Gift; this argueth greatneſs of good will; and conſequently deſerveth a correſpondence of a ſemblable affection. Now what greater gift had Chriſt in ſtore, than to give his own ſpirit? the ſpirit proceedeth from him, and is the ſame eſſence with himſelf; the ſpirit is the third Perſon of the true and only God-head, proceeding from the Father and the Son, and coeternal, coequal, and conſubſtantial with the Father and the Son; this appears by thoſe divine Attributes and Properties which are attributed, and communicated to the holy ſpirit: As, 1. Eternity. God never was without his ſpirit;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>In the beginning God created heaven and earth,—and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</hi> 2. Omnipotency, becauſe he, together with the Father and the Son, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and preſerveth all things, <hi>By his Spirit he hath garniſhed the heavens;</hi>

Omniſciency, or the knowledge of all things, <hi>For the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> 4.

                     <hi>why hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan filled thy heart to lye to the holy Ghoſt?—thou haſt not lyed unto men; but unto God;</hi> (a plain Text for the Divinity of the holy Ghoſt)—<hi>How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> I might add Miracles,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.28. —28.19. 1 Tim. 4.1. 2 Cor. 3.38.</note> and the inſtitution of Sacraments, and Propheſies, and Gifts, and Graces as the effects of his Divinity: <hi>I caſt out devils</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>by the Spirit of God, and baptize in the Name of the Father, and of the Son; and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And <hi>the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith.</hi> And <hi>we are changed into the ſame image from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> See now how the holy ſpirit is God, coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, coequal, and conſubſtantial with God the Father, and God the Son; is not this a great gift? yea, as great a gift as poſſibly can be given? what can he more than to give himſelf, and to give his ſpirit? O the bonds of love that are upon man towards Chriſt in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Come my ſoul and take a view of the Glory and Bounty of Jeſus Chriſt! if thy heart be not all braſs, and iron, and ſtone; if there be any fleſhineſs, ſoftneſs, or plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs in it; why, then how ſhouldſt thou chuſe but love? if either beauty or bounty; if either Majeſty or magnificence can draw thy affection, Chriſt will have it; for in him is all; O let him be thy <hi>all!</hi> ſurely if thou haſt any thing beſides himſelf, he is the Donor of all, he is the beauty of all, the ſum of all, the perfection of all, yea, he is the Author, Preſerver, and Finiſher of all.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. How ſhould it heighten my joys, and enlarge my comforts, when I do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Chriſt is aſcended into glory? by this it is clear and evident, that Chriſt is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Father for me, or otherwiſe he ſhould never have been received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if any frown had been in the face of God, ſurely Chriſt coming ſo near God, he ſhould have had it; if any exception had been againſt his ſatisfaction, any flaw in our pardons, ſurely Chriſt ſhould have heard of it; yea, without queſtion he muſt have been turned out of Heaven, until he had made a full payment of our debts. I need not doubt of my acceptance at the Throne of Grace, when Jeſus Chriſt is accepted for me, and that I ſtand in ſuch a relation to Jeſus Chriſt. Oh what joy is in this!</p>

                     <hi>All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth,</hi> and now he can do what he will; God the Father hath given away (as it were) all his Prerogatives unto Jeſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">John 5.22.</note>

                     <hi>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtency of Chriſt's Spirit in Believers, giveth exiſtence to their hopes of Glory.

                     <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, O my ſoul, ſpread thy ſelf on this great good, Chriſt's Aſcenſion, Chriſt's Seſſion, and Chriſts Miſſion of his Holy Spirit.

There is not any particular here before thee, but 'tis fewel for joy. O what joy was in Heaven, when Chriſt Aſcended, and when Chriſt ſate down at God's right hand, and when Chriſt ſent down the Holy Spirit? how ſtood the Angels wondring and admiring at theſe ſeveral paſſages? how did they ſtoop, and <hi>look with the bowing of the Head, and bending of the Neck,</hi> as the Word implies?<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> and is not thy intereſt in theſe tranſactions more than Angels? O rejoyce, and again rejoyce! ſuppoſe thy ſelf in Heaven, and that thou hadſt a viſion of Chriſt aſcended; ſay, is he not a pleaſant Object? <hi>In his face there is fulneſs of joy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11.</note> Suppoſe thy ſelf to have been in Heaven when he firſt entred into it, and when he firſt ſate down at God's right hand, and ſent down the Comforter to his Saints, was not Heaven full of joy? methinks the very thought of Chriſt's bright Face, and Chriſt's white Throne, and Chriſt's Harpers, and Heavenly Troops ſurrounding the Throne, and Chriſt's welcome to his Father, both for himſelf and all his Saints; and Chriſt's carrying thy name upon his Breaſt before his Father, ſhould fill thy ſoul as full of joy, as poſſibly it can hold. O the firſt-fruits of <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s land, that lyes beyond time and death! O the joyes that were in Heaven at Chriſt's firſt entrance into Heaven! O my ſoul, why doſt thou not check thy ſelf, and lay aſide thy ſad complaints, and forget this Earth, and Earthly troubles? why doſt thou not look up to Jeſus Chriſt, and rejoyce in him who hath done all this for thy Salvation? either the Spirit of God is not thy Comforter, or thou canſt not but receive comfort in theſe paſſages.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. LEt us <hi>conform to Jeſus</hi> in the aforeſaid reſpects. A ſerious beholding of Jeſus in his Aſcenſion, Seſſion, and Miſſion of his Spirit, is enough to change us into the ſame Image from glory to glory. It was the ſweet ſaying of an experienced Saint, <hi>View a glorified Chriſt, ſee him as in that relation and condition, and you will ſoon have the ſparkles of the ſame glory on your hearts.</hi> Chriſt is now exalted, he is now in glory at the right hand of God,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1, 2.</note> O let all our actings be glorious, let all our walkings, joys, breathings be as in glory, <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Christ ſitteth at the right hand of God; ſet your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth.</hi> I ſhall not in this tranſaction lay out many particular conformities to Chriſt's actings, but gather all into one, contained in this Text, which is <hi>heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;</hi> ſeek things above, ſet your affections above; Chriſt is gone up, and Chriſt is ſet down at God's right hand; and herein if you will conform, let your hearts be in Heaven, let your affections be in Heaven, let your converſations be in Heaven: it is the Apoſtles own practiſe wherein ſtood his conformity to Jeſus Chriſt <hi>for our converſation is in heaven.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil 3.20.</note> I do not know any one thing wherein we can be more like to Chriſt exalted, whiles we are upon earth, than to have our hearts, our affections, our converſations with Chriſt where he is: now then if we be vertually riſen with Chriſt, and aſcended with Chriſt, and ſet down with Chriſt in heavenly places, let us ſpiritually aſcend, and ſit down with him in theſe reſpects; certainly there is a proportion in our heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; oh let our converſations be in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>In proſecution of this I ſhall examine theſe <hi>Quaeries.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What do we mean by our converſation in heaven?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why muſt our converſation be in heaven?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By what means muſt we come up to this converſation in heaven;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By our converſation in heaven I mean our aim at heaven; as heaven is our home, ſo our eye is there; whatever we do, our end, our ſcope is to fit us for heaven, and to lay in for heaven, <hi>We look not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtles) <hi>at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.18.</note> 
                     <hi>for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal. We look not</hi>] that is, we aim not at things which are ſeen; inviſible things are the only ſcope and aim of a gracious ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By our converſation in heaven, I mean our communion with Chriſt in heaven. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As it is amongſt
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:94897:224"/> friends that converſe together, they act mutually for the comfort one of another, there is a mutual embracing and opening of their hearts to one another at every turn; ſo in our converſings with Chriſt there is a communion, or a mutual acting of the ſoul upon Chriſt, and of Chriſt upon the ſoul; we let out our hearts to Chriſt, and he lets out his heart to us; eſpecially when we are with Chriſt in his Ordinances; it's not enough to call upon God, and to uſe ſome broken-hearted expreſſions, but <hi>oh, what communion have I with Jeſus Chriſt? I cannot be ſatisfied except I taſte and ſee how good the Lord is; I cannot be quiet, except I hear ſomthing from Heaven this morning.</hi> Why, this is an heavenly converſation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By our converſation in Heaven, I mean our living according to the Laws of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; in all our ways we muſt ſtill enquire, <hi>What rule is there from Heaven to guide me in theſe ways? ſuch and ſuch a thing I have a mind to, but will the Law of Heaven juſtifie me in this? have I any word from Jeſus Chriſt to guide me in this? ſometimes indeed my luſt, my own ends, and the common courſe of the world was my rule; but now I dare not act but according to the Will and Scepter of Jeſus Christ, now I am guided by the Laws of Heaven.</hi> Why, this is an Heavenly converſation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By our converſation in Heaven; I mean our thoughts, and meditations of Heaven and heavenly things; <hi>When I awake</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I am always with thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.18.</note> the hearts of believers are frequently upon their heavenly treaſures; as it is ſtoried of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that a little before her death, ſhe told them, <hi>if they ript her open they would find</hi> Call is <hi>in her heart;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of them whoſe converſation is in Heaven, if you rip them up, you ſhall find Heaven in their hearts; not a day paſſes over their heads without ſome converſe with Heaven, without ſome thoughts or meditations of heaven, and heavenly things.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By our converſation in heaven, I mean our affections on heaven, or on Chriſt in heaven; <hi>Set your affections on things above, (i.e.)</hi> ſet your deſires, loves, hopes, joys,<note place="margin">Col. 3.2.</note> breathings on heavenly things; our affections are precious things, and are onely to be ſet on precious objects; oh what a ſhame is it to ſet our affection on the things of this life! have we a Kingdom, a God, a Chriſt, a Crown in Heaven to ſet our affections upon? and ſhall we ſet them upon droſs, and dung, and ſuch baſe things? are not all our pleaſures and vanities baſe in compariſon of Chriſt? O be not we ſo baſe to ſet our affections on earthly things, but rather on God and Chriſt; and this is our heavenly converſation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By our converſation in Heaven, I mean our tradings, our negotiations for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even whileſt we are upon Earth: the word in the Original points at this, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>our trading is in Heaven;</hi> though our bodies be not there, yet our tradings are there; we carry and behave our ſelves in this life as free Denizons of the City of Heaven; our City whereof we are Citizens, and whereunto we have right, is in Heaven above; in this reſpect we trade not for ſtrifles, as other men do, but we trade for great things, for high things; we merchandize for goodly pearls, even for God, and for Chriſt, who ſitteth at the right hand of God. We ſee now what is meant by our converſation in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why is the converſation of the Saints in Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they know full well, that the Original of their ſouls came from God and Heaven; the body indeed was of the duſt of the ground, but the ſoul was the breath of God; ſo it is ſaid of the firſt man, <hi>God breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>and man became a living ſoul.</hi> The ſoul had a more heavenly and divine Original than any of the other creatures that are here in this neather World; and when God works grace in the ſoul, and ſo it begins to know it ſelf, and to return to it ſelf, it then looks on all things here below as vile, and as contemptible things; it then looks upward, and begins to converſe with things ſutable to its Original. As it is with a child that hath a noble birth; if tranſported into another Country, and there uſed like a ſlave, there ſet to take channels, or (as the Prodigal) to feed ſwine; while he is there, and knows not his Original, he minds nothing but to get victuals, and to do his work that he is ſet about; but if once he come to know from whence he was, that he is indeed born heir to ſuch a Prince, in ſuch a Country; O then his thoughts, and mind, and longings will be altered; <hi>O that I were in my own Country! O that I were with my Father in his Court!</hi> Even ſo it is with the ſouls of the Sons of men, they are the birth (as I may ſo ſpeak) of the great King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; and though by the fall of man they came to be as ſlaves to Satan,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:94897:225"/> yet when God is pleaſed to convert the ſoul; then he diſcovers thus, <hi>Oh man, thou art born from on high, thy ſoul is (as it were) a ſparkle of God himſelf, thou art come from God, and thou art capable of communion with God, even with God the Father, and God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt. O conſider of thy Country whence thou cameſt at firſt, certainly thou never hadſt ſuch a divine and excellent being given thee to delight only in the fleſh, to be ſerviceable only to thy body; O look up unto Jeſus!</hi> why, this it is that turns the heart and ſets the converſation on heavenly things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe their beſt and choice things are already in Heaven, As their Father is in Heaven, and their Saviour is in Heaven, thither he aſcended, and there now he ſits at the right hand of God; their Husband is in Heaven, their Elder Brother is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, their King is in Heaven; their Treaſure is in Heaven, their Inheritance is in Heaven, their Hope is in Heaven, their Manſion is in Heaven, their chief Friends are in Heaven, their Subſtance is in Heaven, their reward is in Heaven, their Wages are in Heaven: and all theſe things being in Heaven, no marvel their converſations be in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe they are going towards Heaven even whiles yet they are on Earth. If the Nobleman (as we formerly ſuppoſed) do once know his condition, and begins his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel homeward towards his Fathers Court, will he not every morning that he riſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them that come from his father to conduct him home? doth it not do him good to hear any man ſpeak of his fathers Country? is it not in his thoughts, in his talk, in his eye, in his aim, at every ſtep? O my ſoul, if thou art indeed travelling towards Heaven, how ſhouldſt thou but have it in thy motions, affections, converſations? how ſhouldſt thou but daily commune with thy own heart? <hi>Heaven is the place that I ſhall come to, ere long I ſhall be there; I know that in this world I am but for a while, but in Heaven I ſhall be for ever and ever;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4.17.</note> 
                     <hi>we ſhall be caught up into the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and ſo ſhall we be ever with the Lord.</hi> Our very travel towards Heaven implies an heavenly converſation,<note place="margin">Pſalm 84.7.</note> 
                     <hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength, till every one of them in Zion appears before God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <note place="margin">Luke 17.21. Heb. 10.34.</note>4. Becauſe much of Heaven is already in the Saints: <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>And knowing in your ſelves that ye have a better and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> Surely if the Saints have much of Heaven within them, it muſt needs be that their converſation is in Heaven; but they <hi>know this in themſelves;</hi> they know it by what God hath revealed in their own hearts; eternal life is already begun in the ſouls of God's people; Heaven is in them, and therefore no marvel if their converſation be in Heaven. My meaning is not as if the Saints had no other Heaven but that within them; I know there is an Heaven above; but ſome pieces, or earneſts, or ſeeds, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of that Heaven above is within them. Is there not a renewed nature, an Image of God, a ſpark of life, a drop of glory in God's people? Surely yes; And if ſo, all theſe will work heaven-ward; principles of grace will have ſome actings of grace till we come to glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By what means ſhould we attain, or come up to have our converſation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us watch opportunities for heavenly exerciſes. God now by his Miniſters calls,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1, 3. 2 Cor. 6.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Come ye to the waters, come ye, buy and eat; come, buy wine, and milk without money; come to me, and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi> Why <hi>now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of ſalvation:</hi> whiles Miniſters call, and we live under the droppings of the Word, theſe are opportunities for Heaven; O then he that never prayed, let him now pray; and he that never heard, let him now hear; the Lord is now come near to us; Chriſt Jeſus is calling, and mercy is entreating, and love is beſeeching, and wiſdom is even hoarſe with crying after us; O lay hold on theſe opportunities for heavenly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and then we ſhall come up to heavenly converſations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed of reſting in the formality of duties; many ſouls that have enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of conſcience, dare not but take opportunities for heavenly duties; but then comes in the temptations of the Devil, and corruptions of their own hearts, and they ſay, <hi>now duty is done, or our task is over, and what needs more?</hi> Alas, alas! It is not <hi>what have we done? but where have we been?</hi> what, have our ſouls been in Heaven, with God, and with Chriſt? have we had any communion with the Father, and with the Son in our duties? O take heed of formality! it will exceedingly hinder our converſation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; O keep our eye ſtill upon our heart! ask in duty, what affections have been acted? how much are we got nearer Heaven thereby? and by this means we ſhall come to an heavenly converſation.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="525" facs="tcp:94897:225"/>3. Let us look up unto Jeſus as hanging on the Croſs, and as ſitting on the Throne: this is the Apoſtles rule, <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> 
                     <hi>who for the joy that was ſet before him endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</hi> Theſe two are the objects of a Chriſtians look who ſtudies an heavenly converſation, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Croſs, and Chriſt's Seſſion; by the Croſs he is Author, and by the Throne he is the Finiſher of our faith; in the firſt is ſet down his love to us, in the ſecond is ſet down our hope of him; with high wiſdom hath the Holy Ghoſt exhorted us with theſe two motives to run, and not to faint: firſt, here is love, love in the Croſs, <hi>Who loved us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5.2.</note> 
                     <hi>and gave himſelf for us, a ſacrifice on the Croſs:</hi> ſecondly, Here is hope, hope in the Throne, <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to ſit with me in my Throne.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3.21.</note> After Chriſt's death he roſe again, aſcended, and is now ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God; and the ſame is our bleſſed hope, Chriſt's Throne is not onely his place, but ours alſo; the love of his Croſs is to us a pledge of the hope of his Throne, or of whatſoever elſe he is worth. Come then, and ſettle your thoughts and looks on this bleſſed object; a ſight of Chriſt's Croſs, but eſpecially of Chriſt's Throne, is a bleſſed means to wean us from the World, and to elevate and raiſe up our affections to things above, yea to form and frame our converſation towards Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us wait for the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Our converſation is in Heaven</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>from whence alſo we look for the Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Where a man's converſation is, there his expectations may be; and where his expectations are, there a man's converſation is, and will be; if we expect ere long, that the Lord Jeſus will appear in glory, and that we ſhall ſee him not with other, but with theſe ſame eyes, the very waiting for theſe things will help our converſation to be heaven-ward. Certainly the day is a coming, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come with his Angels in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and then ſhall the bodies of the Saints ſhine gloriouſly before the Face of God, and Jeſus Chriſt: O the wonder of this day! the glory of Chriſt ſhall then darken the glory of the Sun and Moon, and Stars; but my body ſhall not be darkned, but rather it ſhall ſhine like the glorious body of Chriſt Jeſus; if a candle ſhould be raiſed to have ſo much luſtre and beauty, as if you ſhould put it into the midſt of the Sun, yet it would ſhine, you would think it a ſtrange kind of light; ſurely it ſhall be ſo with the bodies of Saints, for though they are put into the midſt of the glory of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, yet their bodies ſhall ſhine in beauty and luſtre there; now did we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, and wait for it every day, How would it change us? how would it work us to an heavenly converſation? <hi>I have a diſeaſed and lumpiſh body; and my body hinders me in every duty of God's worſhip, but within a while Chriſt will come in his glory, and then he will make my body like unto his glorious body, ſo that I ſhall be able to look upon the face of God, and to be exerciſed in holy duties to all eternity without wearineſs, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: I have many things here that trouble my mind and ſpirit, and that hinder me in my converſe with Heaven, and heavenly things; but within a while, Chriſt will appear with his mighty Angels, to be admitted of his Saints, and then ſhall I ſit as an aſſeſſor on the Throne, with Jeſus Chriſt to judge the world, and then ſhall I live for ever with him, to be where he is, and enjoy all he has, yea all that he hath purchaſed for me by his blood; oh let me wait for this! let me look for it every day! God hath but a little work for me here on Earth, and when that is done, this ſhall be my condition.</hi> Chriſtians! if but every day we would work theſe things on our ſouls, it would be a mighty help to make our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations heavenly converſations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us obſerve the drawings, and movings, and mindings of the Spirit, and follow his dictates; to this purpoſe Chriſt aſcended, and ſate down at God's right hand, and ſent down the holy Spirit, that the Holy Ghoſt being come down, he might do his office in bringing on our ſouls towards ſalvation; and if ever our ſouls get above this earth, and get acquainted with this living in Heaven, it is the Spirit of God that muſt be at the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of <hi>Elijah,</hi> yea the very living principle, by which we muſt move and aſcend; O then take heed of quenching its motions, or reſiſting its workings, take we heed of grieving our guide, or of knocking off the chariot-wheels of this holy Spirit. We little think how much the life of graces, and the happineſs of our ſouls doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our ready and cordial obedience to the Spirit of God; when he forbids us our own known tranſgreſſions, and we will go on, when he tells us which is the way, and which is not, and we will not regard, no wonder if we are ſtrangers to an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation; if we will not follow the Spirit, while it would draw us to Chriſt,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:94897:226" rendition="simple:additions"/> how ſhould it lead us to Heaven, or bring our hearts into the preſence of God? O learn we this leſſon, and let not only the motions of our bodies; but alſo the very thoughts of our hearts be at the Spirits beck! do we not ſometimes feel a ſtrong impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to retire from the world, and to draw near to God? O let us not deſpiſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, but take we the offer, and hoiſe up our ſail, while we may have this bleſſed gale; if we cheriſh theſe motions, and hearken to the Spirit, O what a ſupernatural help ſhould we find to this heavenly mindedneſs, or heavenly converſation?</p>
                  <q>Thus far we have <hi>looked on Jeſus,</hi> as our <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his Aſcenſion, Seſſion, and Miſſion of his holy Spirit, our next work is to <hi>look on Jeſus</hi> carrying on the great work of our ſalvation for us in his Interceſſion, which he makes, and will make to his Father on our behalf, till his ſecond coming to judgment.</q>

In theſe actings of Chriſt in Heaven (if we will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him) we muſt go from glory to glory; no ſooner come we out of one room of glory, but preſently we ſtep into another as glorious as that before: one would think, enough had been ſaid already of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, and of our glory in Chriſt; who would not willingly ſit down under the ſhadow of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and go no further? but yet this is not all; ſo thick and faſt doth the glory of Chriſt break in upon us, that no ſooner out of one, but preſently we are led into the boſom of another. Oh what a bleſſed thing is it to be viewing Chriſt, <hi>and to be looking up to Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> Saints might do nothing elſe (if they pleaſed) but raviſh their hearts with the diverſity of heavenly light and comfort, which breaks forth from the boſom of Jeſus Chriſt. Here is now another myſtery as great, and amazing, as the former, which ſprings out before our eyes in this tranſaction of Chriſt's Interceſſion.</p>
                  <p>And in proſecution of this, as in the former, I ſhall firſt lay down the object, and ſecondly direct you how to look upon it. The object is Jeſus carrying on the great work of our ſalvation in his Interceſſion: in ordering of which, I ſhall examine theſe particulars; —

I call the interceſſion of Chriſt his own <hi>gracious will;</hi> for we muſt not imagine that Chriſt, in his interceſſion, proſtrates himſelf upon his knees before his Fathers Throne, uttering ſome ſubmiſſive form of words or prayers; that is not beſeeming the Majeſty of him that ſits at God's right hand; when he was but yet on Earth, the ſubſtance of his requeſts for his Saints run thus, <hi>Father I will, that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am;</hi> and how much more now he is in Heaven,<note place="margin">John 17.24.</note> is this the form of his interceſſions, <hi>Father I will this, and I will that.</hi> 2. The ground of foundation of Chriſt's interceſſion, is <hi>the ſacrifice, or death of Chriſt;</hi> and hence we make two parts of Chriſt's Prieſt-hood, or oblation; the one expiatory, when Chriſt ſuffered upon the Croſs; the other preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, when he doth appear in Heaven before God for us; the one was finiſhed on Earth, when Chriſt ſuffered without the gate; the other is performed in Heaven, now Chriſt is within the City; the one was a ſacrifice indeed, the other is not ſo much a ſacrifice as the commemoration of a ſacrifice; the firſt was an act of humiliation, and this latter is an act of glory; the firſt was performed once for all, this latter is done continually; the firſt was for the obtaining of redemption, and this latter is for the application of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that the ground of this is that; Chriſt fervently and immoveably deſires his Father for the ſake and vertue of his ſacrifice. 3. The ſubject-matter interceded for, is, that <hi>all the Saints and their ſervice, might find acceptance with God;</hi> firſt Chriſt's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is for our perſons, and then Chriſt's interceſſion is for our works, for as out per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are but in part regenerate, and in part unregenerate; or in part fleſh, and in part ſpirit; ſo be our duties, part good, and part evil; in part ſpiritual, and in part ſinful; now by Chriſt's interceſſion is Chriſt's ſatisfaction applied to our perſons, and by conſequence the defect of our duties is covered and removed; and both we and our works are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and accepted of God the Father. And thus much for the nature of Chriſt's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, what it is.</p>

Joh. 16.26, 27.</note> and partly by deſiring the ſalvation of the Elect: <hi>Chriſt is entred into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.

<pb n="529" facs="tcp:94897:227"/> cannot be uttered.</hi> But what are the interceſſions of the Spirit to the interceſſions of Chriſt? I anſwer, much every way; the Spirits interceſſions are as the effect, and Chriſt's interceſſions are as the cauſe; the Spirits interceſſions are as the Eccho, and Chriſt's interceſſions are as the firſt voice; the ſpirit intercedes for men in and by themſelves, but Chriſt intercedes in his own perſon; there is a dependence of the Spirits interceſſions in us upon Chriſt's interceſſions in himſelf. Firſt, Chriſt by his interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on applies his ſatisfaction made, and lays the ſalve to the very ſore; and then he ſends down his holy ſpirit into our hearts to help our infirmities; and to teach us what to pray, and how to pray as we ought. Now this he doth as God, for who ſhall give a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the ſpirit of God, but God himſelf? it is as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, <hi>ſee holy Spirit, how I take upon me the cauſe of my Saints, I am perpetually repreſenting my ſacrifice to God my Father, I am ever pleading for them, and anſwering all the accuſations that ſin or Satan can lay againſt them; and now go thy way to ſuch and ſuch, and take up thy dwelling in their hearts, and aſſiſt them by thy energy, to plead their own caſe; I am their Advocate or Interceſſor by office, and therefore be thou their Advocate or Interceſſor by operation, inſtruction, inſpiration, and aſſiſtance.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1 John 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> In the work of interceſſion are three perſons, a party offended, a party offending, and the Interceſſor diſtinct from them both; the party offended is God the Father, the party offending is ſinful man, and the Interceſſor diſtinct from them both, is Jeſus Chriſt, the middle perſon (as it were) betwixt God the Father, and us men; the Father is God, and not man; and we that believe in Chriſt are men, and not God; and Chriſt himſelf is both man and God, and therefore, he intercedes and mediates betwixt God and man: If any object, that not only the Father is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but alſo the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore there muſt be a Mediator to them alſo; the ſolution is eaſie; Chriſt's interceſſion is immediately directed to the Father; but becauſe the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, have all one indiviſible eſſence, and by conſequence one will; it therefore follows, that the Father being appeaſed by Chriſt's interceſſion, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are alſo appeaſed with him, and in him I deny not but Chriſt's interceſſion is made to the whole Trinity, but yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and directly to the firſt perſon, and in him to the reſt.—<hi>But if ſo, then in ſome ſenſe</hi> (ſay our adverſaries) <hi>Chriſt makes interceſſion to himſelf, which cannot be; becauſe in every interceſſion there muſt of neceſſity be three parties:</hi> this point hath ſore puzled the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that for the ſolving of it, they knew no other way but to avouch Chriſt to be our interceſſor only as man, and not as God, which is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true; for as both natures did concur in the work of ſatisfaction, ſo likewiſe they do both concur in the work of interceſſion: and 'tis an antient and approved rule, that <hi>names of office, which are given to Chriſt, ſuch as Mediator, Interceſſor,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c. agree unto him according to both natures;</hi> and can the act of Chriſt's interceſſion be the act of Chriſt's manhood alone? what? to hear, and offer up prayers? to receive and preſent the prayers and praiſes, and other ſpiritual ſacrifices of all believers in the World? to negotiate for them all at one and the ſame time, according to the variety and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of their ſeveral occaſions? ſurely this is, and muſt be the work of an infinite, and not of a finite agent; this cannot be effected without the concurrence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature with the humane; but what needs any further anſwer to this objection? ſuppoſe Chriſt intercede to himſelf as God; that is not immediately, and directly to the ſame perſon God the Son, though to the ſame God eſſentially; indeed Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

From the perſonality of man, for he hath only the perſonality of God and not of man. 2. From the firſt perſon of the God-head, who is God the Father,<note place="margin">1 John 5.7.</note> 
                     <hi>for there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt; and theſe three are one,</hi> (i e.) <hi>three perſons, and but one God.</hi>

                     <hi>I pray not for the World,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; whiles Chriſt was on Earth he would not ſo much as ſpend his breath, or open his lips for the World; he knew God would not hear him for them; in like maner Chriſt prays now in Heaven. <hi>Not for the World,</hi> he never had a thought to redeem them, or to ſave their fouls, and therefore they have no ſhare in his interceſſions; I know the objection, that Chriſt upon the the Croſs,<note place="margin">Luke 23.34.</note> prayed for the bloody Jews, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do;</hi> but that might be of private duty as man, who in that reſpect ſubmitted himſelf to the Law of God, which requires that we forgive our enemies, and pray for them that perſecute us, and not of his proper office as Mediator; or if it be referred to the proper mediatory interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt (which I rather think) it will not prove that he prayed for them all univerſally, but only indefinitely, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> only for them that were preſent at his crucifying, and that in ſimplicity of heart, and not of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ignorance, crucified Chriſt; and accordingly this prayer was heard, which ſo many of the Jews were converted at <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. what needs more? his own words are expreſs, that Chriſt's interceſſions are <hi>not for the World,</hi> or reprobates.

                  <p n="5">5. WHat agreement is there betwixt the interceſſions of Chriſt, and the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the High Prieſts of Old? Among the Jews in the times of the Old Teſtament, they had an High-Prieſt, who was in all things to ſtand betwixt God and them. Now as the Jews had their High-Prieſt to intercede for them, ſo the Lord Jeſus was to be the High-Prieſt of our Chriſtian profeſſion, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for us; it will therefore give ſome light to this doctrine of interceſſion, if we will but compare theſe two; and firſt conſider, what agreement betwixt Chriſt and the High-Prieſts of Old; betwixt Chriſt's interceſſion, and the High-Prieſts interceſſions?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt and the High-Prieſts of Old agreed in name; not onely they, but Chriſt himſelf is called an High-Prieſt;<note place="margin">Heb. 8.1. Heb 3.1.</note> 
                     <hi>We have ſuch an High-Prieſt, who is ſet down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high.—Conſider the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.—Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchizedech.</hi> The Old Prieſt-hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> was tranſlated into the Prieſt-hood of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that he was a Prieſt as well as they.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They agreed in office; that conſiſted of two parts, oblation and preſentation; Firſt, They offered a ſacrifice: And ſecondly, They preſented it in the holy of holies, with prayer and interceſſion unto God; the one was done without, the other within the holy of hollies; and in anſwer thereunto there are two diſtinct parts of Chriſt's Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: 1. The offering of himſelf a ſacrifice upon the Croſs: 2. The carrying
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:94897:228"/> of himſelf and of his blood into the holy of holies, or in the heaven of heavens; where he appears and prays in the force of that blood; and this was ſo neceſſary a part of his Prieſt-hood, that without this he had not been a compleat Prieſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.4.</note> 
                     <hi>for if he were on earth, he ſhould not be a Prieſt;</hi> that in, if he ſhould have made his abode upon the earth, he ſhould not have been a compleat or perfect Prieſt, ſeeing this part of it (which we call the preſentation, or interceſſion) lay ſtill upon him to be acted in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And indeed this part of his Prieſt-hood is of the two the more eminent; yea, the top and height of his prieſt-hood; and therefore it is held forth to us in the Types of both thoſe two orders of Prieſt-hood that were before him, and Figures of him, both that of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Melchizedech.</hi> 1. This was Typified in that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Prieſt-hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his fellows; the higheſt ſervice of that Office was the going into the holy of hollies, and making an attonement there; yea, this was the height of the high Prieſt's honour, that he did this alone, and it conſtituted the difference betwixt him as he was high Prieſt, and other Prieſts; for they killed and offered the Sacrifices without as well as he, but only the high Prieſt was to approach the holy of hollies with blood, and that but once a year. 2. This was Typified by <hi>Melchizedech</hi>'s Prieſt-hood, which the Apoſtle argues to have been much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then that of <hi>Aaron's,</hi> in as much as <hi>Levi, Aarons</hi> Father, payed Tythes to this <hi>Melchizedech</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loyns; now <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was his Type, not ſo much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Oblation, or offering Sacrifice, as in reſpect of his continual preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and interceſſion in heaven; and therefore the ſame clauſe, <hi>for ever,</hi> ſtill comes in when <hi>Melchizedech</hi> is named, <hi>thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of</hi> Melchizedech.<note place="margin">Heb. 5.6. — 7.17.</note> Here then is the agreement betwixt Chriſt and the high-Prieſts of old; in reſpect of name, both were Prieſts; and in reſpect of Office, both had their oblations, and preſentations, or interceſſions with God in Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the point of Interceſſion they agreed in theſe particulars.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The high-Prieſt of old, uſually once a year, went into the moſt Holy place within the vail; and ſo is Chriſt our great high-Prieſt paſſed into the Heavens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vail, even into the holy of holies. <hi>Chriſt by his own blood entred in once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy place—Not into the holy places made with hands,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9.12, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>which are the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the true, but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The high-Prieſts of old had a plate of pure Gold upon their Fore-heads, which was <hi>to bear the iniquity of the holy things, that they might be accepted before the Lord;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 28.38.</note> and ſo doth Chriſt bear the iniquity of our holy things. Spiritual Chriſtians! here is your comfort, you are not able to perform any duty to God, but there is a great deal of ſin in the ſame; you cannot hear, nor pray, nor confer, nor meditate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſin; but Chriſt bears all theſe ſins, even the iniquity of your holy things, and he preſents your perſons, and prayers without the leaſt ſpot to his Father; he is <hi>the Angel of the Covenant that ſtands at the Altar,</hi>

                     <hi>having a golden Cenſer. with much incenſe; to offer it with the prayers of his Saints,</hi> and ſo they are acceptable before the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> high-Prieſts, <hi>bore the names of the Children of Iſrael on a breaſt-plate of judgment upon their hearts for a memorial before the Lord continually;</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Continually, in preſenting of them to his Father as they are in him: how is that? why, he repreſents them without ſpot, as righteous in his own righteouſneſs;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.27.</note>

                     <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> What the difference is betwixt Chriſt's interceſſions, and the interceſſions of the high Prieſts of old.</head>
                  <p n="6">6. VVHat is the difference betwixt Chriſt's Interceſſions, and the interceſſions of the high Prieſts of old? There is no queſtion, but howſoever they might agree in ſome reſpects, yet Chriſt officiates in a more tranſcendent and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent way then ever any high Prieſt did before him; now the difference betwixt Chriſt and them, and betwixt Chriſt's Interceſſions and their Interceſſions, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in theſe particulars.—</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4.14.</note>1. They were called <hi>high Priests,</hi> but Chriſt is called <hi>the great high Prieſt;</hi> ſuch a Title was never given to any but Chriſt; whence the Apoſtle argues for the ſteadfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our profeſſion: <hi>ſeeing then that we have a great high Prieſt, that is paſſed into the heavens, Jeſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The high-Prieſts then were <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, but Chriſt our great high-Prieſt is the Son of God; for ſo he is ſtyled in the ſame verſe, the great high-Prieſt that is paſſed into the heavens,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeſus the Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The high-Prieſts then were but for a time, but Chriſt is a <hi>Prieſt for ever after the order of</hi> Melchizedech.<note place="margin">Heb. 5.6. Heb. 7.3.</note> Melchizedech (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>was without Father, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mother, without deſcent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life.</hi> That is, as far as it is known; and ſo is Chriſt without a Father on earth, and without a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven; without beginning, and without end; he abides a Prieſt perpetually, even to the end of the World; yea, and the vertue of his Prieſthood, is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all time, even for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The high-Prieſts then entred only into that place that was Typically holy, but Chriſt is entred into that place that is properly holy; he is entred into the Heavens, or (if you will) as into the holy of holies, ſo into the heaven of heavens.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The high Prieſts then did not always intercede for the people; only once a year the high Prieſt entred into the holy of holies; and after he had ſprinkled the mercy-ſeat with blood, and cauſed a cloud to riſe upon the mercy-ſeat with his Prayers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, then he went out of the holy of holies, and laid aſide his Garments again; but our great high Prieſt is aſcended into the holy of holies, never to put off his princely-prieſtly garments: nor does he only once a year ſprinkle the mercy-ſeat with his ſacrifice, but every day; he lives for ever to intercede; Oh what comfort is this to a poor dejected Soul! if he once undertakes thy cauſe, and get thee into his prayers, he will never leave thee out night nor day; he intercedeth eyer, till he ſhall accompliſh and finiſh thy Salvation; the ſmoak of his incenſe aſcends for ever without intermiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The high-Prieſts then interceded not for ſins of greater inſtances; if a man ſinned ignorantly, there was indeed a Sacrifice, and Interceſſion for him; but <hi>if a man ſinned preſumptuouſly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 15.30.</note> 
                     <hi>he was to be cut off from among his people;</hi> no Sacrifice, no Interceſſion by the high Prieſt then; but we have ſuch an high Prieſt as makes Interceſſion for all ſins; every ſin though it boyl up to blaſphemy (ſo it be not againſt the holy Ghoſt) ſhall by the vertue of Chriſt's interceſſion be forgiven. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a fountain opened to the houſe of David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> 
                     <hi>and to the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem for ſin, and for uncleanneſs, (i.e.)</hi> for ſins of all ſorts. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, all ſins ſhall be forgiven unto the Sons of Men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 3.28.</note> 
                     <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Scarlet ſins, or crimſon ſins; ſins of the deepeſt dye ſhall by Chriſts Interceſſion be done away; the voice of his blood ſpeaks better things than the Blood of <hi>Abel;</hi> it intercedes for the abolition of bloody ſins.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="539" facs="tcp:94897:229"/>7. The high Prieſts then interceded not without all theſe materials, <hi>viz.</hi> A Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, an Altar, a Sacrifice of a young Bullock for a ſin-offering,<note place="margin">Levit. 16.3.</note> and a Ram for a burnt offering; a Cenſer full of burning coals of fire taken off the Altar, a putting the incenſe upon the fire, that the cloud of the incenſe might cover the mercy-ſeat, a ſprinkling the mercy-ſeat with the blood of the Bullock, and of the Goat with their finger, ſeven times; ſuch materials they had, and ſuch actions they did, which were all diſtinct as from themſelves; but Jeſus Chriſt in his Interceſſions now needs none of theſe materials; but rather he himſelf and his own merits are inſtead of all. As, 1. He is the Temple, either in regard of the Deity, the gold of the Temple being ſanctified by the Temple, or in regard of his humane body, <hi>deſtroy this Temple,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and I will build it again in three dayes;</hi> it was deſtroyed, and God found it an acceptable Sacrifice, and ſmelt in it a ſweet ſavor as in a Temple. 2. He is the Altar according to his Deity, for as the Altar ſanctifies the gift, ſo doth the God-head ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the man-hood; The Altar muſt needs be of a greater dignity than the oblation, and therefore this Altar betokens the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt. 3. He is the Sacrifice moſt properly according to the Man-hood, for although by communication of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties the blood of the Sacrifice is called the <hi>blood of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> yet properly the human Soul and fleſh of Chriſt was the Holocauſt, or whole burnt-offering roaſted in the fire of his Fathers wrath. 4. His merits are the cloud of Incenſe, for ſo the Angel; Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to have a golden Cenſer, and much Incenſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 8.3, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar which was before the Throne; and the ſmoke of the Incenſe which came with the Prayers of the Saints aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand:</hi> the merits of Chriſt are ſo mingled with the prayers of his Saints, that they perfume their Prayers, and ſo they find acceptance with God his Father. We ſee now the difference betwixt Chriſts Interceſſions, and the Interceſſions of the high Prieſts of Old.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> What the Properties of this Interceſſion of Chriſt are.</head>
                  <p n="7">7. WHat are the properties of this Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt? I anſwer.— 1. It is heavenly and glorious; and that appears in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt doth not fall upon his knees before his Father, as in the days of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; for that is not agreeable to that glory he hath received; he only preſents his pleaſure to his Father, that he may thereto put his Seal and Conſent. 2. Chriſt doth not pray out of private charity as the Saints pray one for another in this life, but out of publick Office of mediation, <hi>there is one God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note> 
                     <hi>and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jeſus.</hi> 3. Chriſt prayes not out of humility, which is the propoſing of requeſts for things unmerited, but out of authority, which is the deſiring of a thing, ſo as withall he hath a right of beſtowing it, as well as deſiring it. 4. Chriſt prays not merely as an advocate, but as a propitiation too; Chriſt's Spirit is an advocate, but only Chriſt is advocate and propitiation; Chriſts Spirit is our advocate on earth, but only Chriſt in his Perſon applyeth his merits in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and furthers the cauſe of our ſalvation with his Father in heaven. In every of theſe reſpects we may ſee Chriſts interceſſions is heavenly and glorious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is ever effectual and prevailing: as he hath a power to intercede for us, ſo he hath a power to confer that upon us for which he intercedes.<note place="margin">John 14 16. John 16.7.</note> 
                     <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall give you another Comforter. If I go not away the comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart I will ſend him unto you.</hi> If Chriſt prayed on earth, he was ever heard, but if Chriſt prayed in heaven, we may be ſure the Father ever hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and anſwereth there; when Chriſt as man prayed for himſelf, he was heard in that which he feareth, but now Chriſt as Mediator praying for us, he is ever heard in the very particular which he deſireth.<note place="margin">James 4.3.</note> We ſinful men many a time <hi>ask and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not, becauſe we ask amiſs, that we may conſume it upon our Luſts;</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt never asks amiſs; nor to wrong ends; and therefore God the Father who called him to this Office of being (as it were) the great <hi>Maſter of Requeſts in behalf of his Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 11.41, 42.</note> he promiſeth to hear him in all his requeſts. <hi>Father, I thank thee that thou haſt heard me, and I know thou heareſt me alwayes,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is of all other the tranſactions of Chriſt, till the very end of the World, the moſt perfective and conſummate: indeed ſo perfective, that without it all the other
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:94897:230"/> parts of Chriſt's Mediatorſhip would have been to little purpoſe. As the Sacrifices under the Law had not been of ſuch force and efficacy, had not the high Prieſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the holy place to appear there, and to preſent the blood there unto the Lord; ſo all that ever Chriſt did or ſuffered upon earth, it had been ineffectual unto us, had he not entred into heaven,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.24.</note> 
                     <hi>to appear there in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Surely this Interceſſion is that which puts life into the death of Chriſt; this Interceſſion is that which ſtrikes the laſt ſtroak during this World, in the carrying on of our ſouls Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Chriſt ſet forth. Rom. 8.34.</note> and makes all ſure. It is a witty obſervation that one makes of theſe ſeveral ſteps of Chriſts actings for us; as firſt, there was an all-ſufficiency in his death, <hi>who ſhall condemn? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> 2. <hi>A rather</hi> in his Reſurrection; <hi>yea rather,</hi> that is riſen again. 3. <hi>A much rather</hi> in his life and ſeſſion at God's <hi>right hand, for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of Chriſt, much rather being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> 4. The Apoſtle riſeth yet higher to <hi>a ſaving to the utmost,</hi> and puts that upon his interceſſion; <hi>wherefore he is able to ſave us to the utmoſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</hi> If in the former were any thing wanting, this interceſſion of Chriſt ſupplies all; it is the <hi>Coronis,</hi> which makes all effectual; it ſaves to the uttermoſt, for it ſelf is the uttermoſt and higheſt ſtep; on earth Chriſt begins the execution of his office, in heaven he ends it; in his life and death Chriſt was the meritorious cauſe, but by his interceſſion Chriſt is the applying cauſe of our ſouls ſalvation. In this very Interceſſion of Chriſt is the conſummation and perfection of the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt. O then how requiſite and neceſſary muſt this needs be?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is gracious, and full of bowels; Chriſt his interceſſion, and indeed Chriſt's Prieſtly office is erected, and ſet up on purpoſe, for the relief of poor diſtreſſed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. There is no mixture of terror in this bleſſed office of Jeſus Chriſt, and this doth diſtinguiſh it from his other offices. Chriſt by his Kingly office rules over the Churches, and over the World; but all obtain not mercy whom he thus rules over; Chriſt by his prophetical office comes to his own, but many of his own recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not; but now wherever the Prieſtly office of Jeſus Chriſt is let forth upon a Soul, that ſoul ſhall certainly be ſaved for ever. O this Prieſtly office of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an office of meer love and tender compaſſion:<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is ſuch an high-Prieſt as cannot be but touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</hi> Oh he is <hi>a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2.17.</note> 
                     <hi>and a faithful high Prieſt in things partaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the People.</hi> He is mercifull and exceeding compaſſionate; <hi>in all our afflictions he is afflicted;</hi>

In a publick manner; whatſoever he did in this kind, he did it openly and publickly; he appears for us in the preſence of God the Father; he appears for us in the preſence of his Saints and Angels; heavens eyes are all upon him in his appearing for us. 2. He appears for us as a Mediator, he ſtands in the middle betwixt God and us; hence it is, that he is God-man, that he might be a Mediator betwixt God and man. 3. He appears for us as a Sponſor, and a pledge; ſurely it is a comfort for a man to have a friend at Court, at the Princes elbow, that may own him, and appear for him; but if this friend be both a Mediator and Surety, a Mediator to requeſt for him, and a Surety to engage for him.<note place="margin">Phil. 9.10. ver. 18, 19.</note> Oh what comfort is this! thus Chriſt appeared in every reſpect; he is a Mediator to requeſt for us; and he is a Surety to engage for us: as <hi>Paul,</hi> was for

                     <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> An Advocate is more than a Solicitor; an Advocate is one that is of Counſel with an other, and that pleadeth his Caſe in open Court; and ſuch an advocate is Jeſus Chriſt unto his people. 1.

When he went to heaven, he carried with him abſolutely the Power, Merit, the vertue of his Wounds, and Death, and Blood into the preſence of God the Father for us; and with his blood he ſprinkled the Mercy-ſeat (as it were) ſeven times. We read
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:94897:231"/> in the Law, that <hi>When the high Prieſt went within the vail; he took the blood of the Bullock, and ſprinkled it with his finger upon the mercy-ſeat Eaſt-ward:</hi>

It is upon mount <hi>Zion</hi> where this ſprinkling is: there is Jeſus at God's right hand, there he ſtands (as it were) upon the mount,<note place="margin">Levit. 16.14, 19.</note> and there he ſprinkles his blood round about him; heaven is all beſprinkled, as the <hi>mercy-ſeat</hi> in the holy of holies was; the earth is all beſprinkled, as the <hi>Altar</hi> out of the holy of holies was; heaven and earth are all beſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus, ſo that the Saints and people of God are no where, but their doors, and their poſts, and houſes (I mean their bodies and ſouls) are all beſprinkled with the blood of the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the World. Why, this is that <hi>blood of ſprinkling that ſpeaks better things than that of</hi> Abel. Mark, that Chriſt's blood hath a tongue; it ſpeaks, it cries, it prayes, it intercedes; there's ſome agreement, and ſome difference betwixt Chriſts blood and <hi>Abels</hi> blood.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 4.10.</note>1.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>I know it is a queſtion, whether Chriſt now in heaven do indeed, and truth, and in right propriety of ſpeech pray for us? ſome able Divines are for the Negative, others for the Affimative. For my part (leaving a liberty to thoſe otherwiſe minded according to their light) I am of opinion, that Chriſt doth not only intercede by an interpretative Prayer, as in the preſenting of himſelf, and his merits to his Father; but alſo by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs prayer, or by an expreſs and open repreſentation of his will: and to this opinion methinks theſe Texts agree. <hi>I will pray the Father,</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt's Interceſſion conſiſts in the preſenting of our perſons in his own perſon to his Father, ſo that now God cannot look upon the Son, but he muſt behold the Saints in his Son; are they not members of his body, in near relation to himſelf? and are not all his Interceſſions in behalf of them, and only of them? but how are all the Elect carried up into heaven with Jeſus Chriſt, and there ſet down before his Father in Jeſus Chriſt? I anſwer, not actually, but myſtically; when Chriſt intercedes, he takes our perſons, and carries them in unto God the Father in a moſt unperceiveable way to us; for the way or manner I leave it to others, for my part, I dare not be too inquiſitive in a ſecret not revealed by God; only this we ſay, that Chriſt preſents our perſons to his Father in his own perſon; and this was plainly ſhadowed out by that act or office of the high Prieſt, who went into the holy of holies,<note place="margin">Exod. 28.12.</note> with <hi>the names of all the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael <hi>upon his ſhoulders, and upon his breaſt;</hi> and this the Apoſtle ſpeaks out yet more plainly, <hi>by him we have an acceſs unto the Father,</hi>

                     <hi>the Lord rebuke thee O Satan, even the Lord that hath choſen</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>rebuke thee;</hi> twice he repeats it, to ſhew the fulneſs of Chriſt's interceſſion, <hi>q. d.</hi> the Lord my God, my everlaſting Father, rebuke, and confound thee Satan, in this thy malicious oppoſition againſt my <hi>Joſhua;</hi> and then he goes on in his apology for <hi>Joſhua;</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5.4, 5.</note>2. That Chriſt was called to this office by God. <hi>Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an High-Prieſt;</hi> no, no; but <hi>he was called of God as</hi> Aaron <hi>was;</hi> it was God the Father that deſigned him to it, and that furniſhed him for it, and that inveſted him in it;<note place="margin">Pſalm 110.4.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of</hi> Melchizedech. Now to what purpoſe ſhould God call him to this office, but eſpecially to intercede for them, to whom God was willing to communicate ſalvation? it was God's mind as well as Chriſt's mind to ſave his Elect; and this was the way where on they agreed; that an High-Prieſt ſhould be appointed, and an office of interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be erected, and by that means the ſalvation purchaſed ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; many times we are apt to conceive legal or law-thoughts of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that he is juſt and ſevere; and that Chriſt his Son is more meek, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful: but this cannot be, for there are not two infinite wills, not two infinite mercies, one in the Father, another in the Son, but one will, and one mercy in both. And to that purpoſe obſerve but the readineſs of God the Father to receive Chriſt honourably
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:94897:233"/> into heaven, that he might do the work of the High Prieſt there; no ſooner had <hi>Chriſt</hi> entred through the gates into the City, but preſenly, <hi>ſit thou down</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>at my right hand;</hi> but to what end? ſurely not only to rule as King (of which we have ſpoken before) but alſo to intercede as our great High Prieſt; hence we find in Scripture, that Chriſt's ſeſſion and interceſſion; his Kingly and Prieſtly office are joyned together;<note place="margin">Heb. 8.1.</note> 
                     <hi>He is ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens:</hi> he! who? why, <hi>Chriſt</hi> our High Prieſt; we have ſuch an High Prieſt who is ſet down.

                  <p n="3">3. That Chriſt is God's Son; and that is more than God's High Prieſt; he is his natural Son, his beloved Son, his Son that never gave him the leaſt offence; ſure then when he comes and intercedes for a man, he is moſt like to ſpeed; if a gracious child do but cry, <hi>my Father, my Father,</hi> he may prevail very much, eſpecially with a Father who is tender-hearted; Jeſus Chriſt is the gracious, precious Son of God the father; and God the Father is a dear and kind-hearted Father, how then ſhould the interceſſions of Chriſt but be moſt powerful with God? hence ſome gather the prevalency of Chriſt's interceſſion, becauſe in many places of Scripture where this part of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Prieſt-hood or interceſſion is laid down, this Sonſhip is alſo expreſſed or ſet forth;<note place="margin">Heb. 4.14.

                     <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> ſaith God? O then how prevalent muſt Chriſt's interceſſion be with God?</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="5">5. That Chriſt is God's darling upon this very account, becauſe he intercedes for his People. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life,</hi>

O then what delights, what variety, what infinite of delights hath God in Chriſt now interceding for us? what a dear darling is Chriſt to God, when not only he ſtands by him, but he repreſents to him all the Elect from the beginning to the end of the World; <hi>q. d, See Father, look on my breaſt, read hear all the names of thoſe thou haſt given me, as</hi> Adam, <hi>and</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob; <hi>of the Twelve Tribes, and of the Twelve Apoſtles, of all the Martyrs, Profeſſors, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Law and Goſpel;</hi> I <hi>pray for them,</hi> I <hi>Pray not for the World, but only for them, for they are mine;</hi> methinks I hear God anſwer, <hi>What my Son! and what the Son of my womb! and what the Son of my vows! haſt thou begotten me thus many Sons? and are all theſe mine? why then ask what thou wilt, and have what thou pleaſeſt; I am as ſtrongly inclined and diſpoſed to give thee grant, as thou wouldſt have it; it is my joy, my delight, my pleaſure to ſave theſe ſouls, and ſurely the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in thy hands.</hi>

It is the Fathers will that it ſhould be ſo; he called <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to this office,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.36, 37.</note> the command of God is upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; Ask what thou what wilt for thy redeemed ones,</hi> I <hi>willingly engage my ſelf to grant, onely it is my pleaſure thou ſhouldſt ask:</hi> as ſometimes he ſaid to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, I the Lord have ſpoken, and I will do it; notwithſtanding</hi> I <hi>will yet for this be enquired of, by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them:</hi> ſo ſaith God to Chriſt, <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken, and I will do it, only my Son, I will be enquired of by thee. I</hi> look upon this as the main reaſon of Chriſt's interceſſion, <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight;</hi> it's God's will that Chriſt ſhould intercede.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the Father's love to engage his Son for his own people. O the comfort of a ſound Chriſtian in this reſpect! what, art thou in temptation, or deſertion? ſurely Chriſt is engaged by God to petition for thee; thou haſt put up many petitions to
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:94897:235"/> Chriſt, and he hath put them all up unto God; he could do no otherwiſe, for he is in place an Advocate, to mention and plead ſuch caſes as are moved to him. Methinks I imagine God thus beſpeaking his Son; <hi>See thou do this poor ſoul good my Son; here is for him according to all his needs, only ask according to what thou knoweſt will make him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; muſt he have my Spirit? my comforting Spirit? will no leſs, no cheaper thing ſerve his turn? then here it is.</hi> Oh how is Chriſt engaged now to petition for them, whom God loves, and for whom he gave himſelf? ſurely if Chriſt ſhould leave to intercede for ſuch, he would diſpleaſe his Father, which we know he would not do, he would undergo Hell firſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is Chriſt's own inclination to do his Office: the power that Chriſt hath for the good of Sinners is neceſſarily acted: as the Sun ſhines upon all the World, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do otherwiſe; ſo Chriſt the Son of righteouſneſs, ſhines or intercedes for all his Saints, and he can do no leſs: what is the will of the Father, is the will of Chriſt, (I mean the will of Chriſt naturally, not artificially in a way of ſelf-denial, as God's will it is ſaid to be our will) ſo that what the Father would have Chriſt own, he cannot but own; for the ſame Spirit is in Chriſt which is is in the Father, and in the ſelf-ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: As God is captivated with love towards all captives, ſo am I, ſaith Chriſt; as God would have all be ſaved, and to come to the knowledg of the truth, ſo would I too ſaith Chriſt. The very ſame bottomleſs ſea of love, that fluctuates in my Father's breſt,<note place="margin">John 10.30.</note> it is in my breſt, <hi>For I and the Father are one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is Chriſt's honour to intercede: hereby is the Crown ſet on Chriſt's head, much honour and glory redowns to Jeſus in this very reſpect. I believe all the work that's done in Heaven, it is Chriſt interceding, and the Saints and Angels praiſing; Chriſt intercedes for ever, and the four beaſts, and four and twenty-Elders ſing for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8, 9, 10, 11. an argument of Chriſt's honour, by Chriſt's interceſſion, is given in thus by Maſter <hi>Goodwin;</hi> if it were not for Chriſt's interceſſion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Goodwins,</hi> Chriſt ſet forth.</note> how would the Office of Chriſt's Prieſthood be out of work? And this reaſon is more than intimated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24, 25.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.24, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>This man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſthood;</hi> and the work of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is interpreted, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>To make interceſſion for ever.</hi> The meaning of this is, that God would not have him continue to be a Prieſt in title only, or in reſpect onely of a ſervice paſt, and ſo to have only the honour of Prieſthood perpetuated to him, out of the remembrance of what he once had done: But God would have him to enjoy, as the renown of the old, to a perpetual ſpring of honour by this new work of interceſſion, and ſo to preſerve the verdure of his glory ever freſh and green; and the ſum of the Apoſtles reaſoning is this, that ſeeing himſelf was to be for ever, ſo his work of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſhould be for ever, that ſo his honour might be preſerved and continued for ever alſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is Chriſt's love to his Saints; his heart is ſo inamoured with his Saints, that therefore he intercedes for them for ever; <hi>Love is as ſtrong as death;</hi> it is never weary of doing good for the party beloved; now Chriſt's Saints are Chriſt's love; <hi>My ſiſter, my love,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 5.2. Mal. 3.17. John 15.19. Iſa. 43.20.</note> 
                     <hi>my dove;</hi> the Saints in Chriſt's books are ſo many jewels, <hi>And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of hoaſts, in that day when I make up my jewels;</hi> the Saints are Chriſt's only choyce, the very flower of the Earth; <hi>You have I choſen out of the world;</hi> and ye are <hi>my people, my choſen;</hi> All the World is Chriſt's refuge, and Kings are but morter to him, onely the Saints are Chriſt's choſen, they are they whom the Lord in his eternal councels hath ſet a part for himſelf; <hi>But know</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is Godly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">pſalm. 4.3.</note> The Saints are <hi>Chriſt's</hi> image <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all that which is his chief excellency, I mean in his righteouſneſs and holineſs; as if I would take the picture of a man, I would not draw it to reſemble his back-parts, but as near as <hi>I</hi> could, I would draw it to life, the very face and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; ſo are the Saints the very picture, the image, the draught of God in his top excellency. The Saints are in covenant with Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore in nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation than any others; hence it is that they are called the portion of God, the treaſure of God, the peculiar people of God; thoſe that God and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſatisfie themſelves in, thoſe that God and Chriſt have ſet their hearts on; the children of God the Father, the very Spouſe and bride of God the Son; in ſome reſpect nearer than the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the Angels are not ſo married to Chriſt in a myſtical union, as God's people are; now is it any wonder that thoſe who are ſo very dear to Chriſt, ſhould be in the prayers of Chriſt? if they were ſo much in his heart, that ſometimes be ſhed his blood for them, will he not now intercede for? O yes! to this end he carries them on his
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:94897:235"/> breaſt or heart, as near as near may be, that they may be in a continual remembrace before the Lord for ever; his very love compels him to this office, to intercede for them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is Chriſt's delight to intercede for his Saints? before the world was,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.31. Pſalm 40 7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights were with the ſons of men;</hi> and when the fulneſs of time came, then ſaid he, <hi>Lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy Will O my God;</hi> and what was that, but to be with the ſons of men? he knew that was his Fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in reſpect of himſelf, he had a delight to live with them, and to dye for them: and no ſooner he entred into Heaven, but there he delights to officiate ſtill in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the ſons of men; he carries their names on his heart there, and though ſome of their perſons be on earth, and he in his bodily preſence is in Heaven, yet diſtance of place cannot deaden his delights in the remembrance of them; he is ever minding his Father of his people in the neather world; he tells him that they are his, <hi>all in all,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, all his joy, and all his delight, and all his portion; as men uſe to give portions to their children, ſo God having but one Son by eternal generation, he hath given the Elect unto him as his portion; and hence he makes it his great buſineſs in Heaven, to provide manſions for his portion, to take up God's heart for his portion, to beg favour and love for his portion. Here 'tis the joy of Chriſt in Heaven, in going to his Father, and telling him, <hi>Why Father? I have a ſmall portion yet on earth, and becauſe they are on earth, they are ſtill ſinning againſt thy Majesty, but I have ſuffered and ſatisfied for their ſins, and hither am I come, to mind Thee of it, and contiunally to get out freſh pardons for new ſins; come, look on my old ſatisfaction; didſt Thou not promiſe?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>is it not in the Articles of agreement betwixt Thee and me, that I ſhould ſee of the travel of my ſoul, and ſhould be ſatisfied? didſt Thou not ſay, that becauſe I poured out my ſoul, therefore Thou wouldſt divide me a portion with the great, and the ſpoyle with the ſtrong? O my Father, now I make interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors; give me out pardons for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand millions of ſins; Thou haſt ſaid and ſworn, that Thou haſt no pleaſure in the death of ſinners; and it is my pleaſure, my joy, my infinite delight, to ſave ſinners; theſe are my ſeed, my portion, my redeemed ones, and therefore let them be ſaved.</hi> Thus Chriſt intercedes, and his delight in his Saints, as knowing it to be his Fathers mind, draws him on to this interceſſion; indeed this reaſon hangs upon that primary, and firſt reaſon; it is God's will that Chriſt ſhould intercede; as it is Chriſt's delight to do the will of his Father in Heaven, <hi>I delight to do thy Will O my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is Chriſts compaſſion that cauſeth interceſſion. <hi>Chriſt is ſuch an high Prieſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as cannot but be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. He was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> When he was on earth, he felt our infirmities, frailties, miſeries, and as a man that hath felt the Stone, or Gout, or Fever; or eſpecially that hath felt ſoul-troubles, cannot but compaſſionate thoſe that are in the like condition; ſo Chriſt having had the experience of our outward, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſufferings, he cannot but compaſſionate us; and hence it is (his very compaſſion's moving) that he intercedes to his Father in our behalf. It is obſerved, that the very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or work of the High-Prieſt, was to ſympathize with the people of God; onely in the caſe of the death of his kindred; he was not as others, to ſympathize or mourn; but Jeſus Chriſt goes beyond all the High-Prieſts that ever were before him; he doth fully ſympathize with us, not in ſome, but in all conditions; <hi>In all our afflictions he is afflicted.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 63.9.</note> I believe Chriſt hath carried a man's heart up with him to Heaven; and though there be no paſſions in him as he is God; yet the flower, the bloſſom, the excellency of all theſe paſſions, (which we call compaſſions) are infinitely in him as he is God; he ſtriketh, and tryeth, and yet he pittieth; when <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaneth himſelf, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon? is he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 31.21.</note> 
                     <hi>I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore my bowels are troubled for him.</hi> Surely there's a violence of heavenly paſſion in Chriſt's heart as God-man, which makes him to break out into prayer to God, and into compaſſions towards Men: O that tempted ſouls would conſider this! it may be Chriſt is giving you a cup of tears and blood to drink, but who knows what bowels, what turnings of heart, what motions of compaſſion are in Jeſus Chriſt all the while? thoſe who feel the fruit of Chriſt's interceſſion know this, and cannot but ſubſcribe to this truth. <hi>O ye of little faith,</hi> why do ye doubt of Chriſt's bowels? is he not our compaſſionate High-Prieſt? hath not the tendereſt, meekeſt, mildeſt heart of a man that God poſſibly can form, met with the eternal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:94897:236"/> mercy of God himſelf in Jeſus Chriſt? you have heard that Chriſt in both natures is our High-Prieſt, Mediator, Interceſſor, and if either God or Man know how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note> Chriſt muſt do it. O the bowels of Chriſt! <hi>He is touched</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>with the feeling of our infirmities;</hi> it is an alluſion to the rolled and moved bowels of God, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. Chriſt in Heaven is burning and flaming in a paſſion of compaſſion towards his weak ones; and therefore he pleads, intercedes, and prays to God for them.</p>

                  <p>LET us know Jeſus carrying on this great work of our ſalvation in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Is it not a rare piece of knowledge to know what Chriſt is now do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Heaven for us on Earth? If I had a weighty ſuite at Court, on which lay my eſtate and life, if I knew that I had a friend there that could prevail, and that he were juſt now moving in my behalf, were not this worth the knowledge? I dare ſay in the behalf of all believers in the World, Chriſt is now interceding for us at the right hand of God; ever ſince his aſcenſion into Heaven he hath been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this work; it is a work already of above ſixteen hundred years; and Summer and Winter, Night and day, without any tiredneſs of Spirit; Chriſt hath been ſtill praying, ſtill interceding; Chriſt's love hath no vacation, no ceſſation at all: yea, even now whiles you read this, Chriſt is acting as an Advorate for you, Chriſt hath your names ingraven, as a ſeal on his heart; and ſtanding right oppoſite to the eye of his Father, the firſt opening of the eye-lids of God is terminated upon the breaſt of Jeſus Chriſt; Is not this worth the knowledge? O my ſoul, leave off thy vain ſtudies of natural things! if they do not conduce ſome way or other to the right underſtanding of this, they are not worth the while; What is it for an <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to be praiſed where he is not, and to be damned where he is? O the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt! ſuch a knowledge (if true) is no leſs than ſaving. Come, ſtudy his interceſſion in all the former particulars; I have run them over, for the work is ſwoln under my hands, and I would now abbreviate; only remember this, that in Chriſt's interceſſion are many ſecrets which we muſt never know on this ſide Heaven; oh take heed of entring into this labarinth without the clew of the Word; above all deſire the guidance of the Spirit to enlighten thy darkneſs, and what ever thou knoweſt, <hi>know it ſtill for thy ſelf.</hi>

                     <pb n="553" facs="tcp:94897:236"/>1. Conſider of the nature of Chriſt's interceſſion: what is it but the gracious Will of Chriſt fervently deſiring that for the vertue of his death, and ſacrifice, thy perſon and performances might be accepted of God? As Chriſt on earth gave himſelf to the death, even to the death of the Croſs for the abolition ſin, ſo now in Heaven he prayes the Father, <hi>by his agony and bloody ſweat, by his his croſs and paſſion, by his death and ſacrifice,</hi> that thy ſins may be pardoned, thy ſervice accepted, and thy ſoul ſaved. This is the Will of Chriſt, even thy juſtification, ſanctification, and ſalvation; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he preſents his Will, <hi>Father I will that all thoſe priviledges flowing from my death may be conferred on ſuch a perſon by name; ſuch a ſoul is now meditating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of my interceſſion, and my will is that his very meditation may find acceptance with God.</hi> O what workings would be in thy heart and ſpirit, if thou didſt but conſider that Chriſt even now were ſpeaking his Will, that thy perſon and duty might both find acceptance, and be well-pleaſing with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider of the perſon that intercedes for thee; it is Chriſt in both Natures; it is thy Mediator; the middle one betwixt God and man; in this reſpect thou mayſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as one indifferent, and equally inclining to either party, like a pair of ſcales that hang even, neither ſide lift up, or depreſſed more than the other;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.20.</note> 
                     <hi>A Mediator is not of one,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Chriſt indifferently partook of both Natures, God-head, and Manhood, that ſo he might be fit to ſtand in the gap between his Father and us; he is a Prieſt according to both Natures; he is a Dayes-man wholly for God, and a Dayes-man wholly for us, and on our ſide.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider of the perſon to whom Chriſt intercedes; is it not to his Father? Thou art ſure to ſpeed well, O my ſoul, for God is the Father of thy Interceſſor. If I had a ſuit to ſome Majeſty, and the Prince would but mediate, I might hope to ſpeed; Chriſt is Gods's Prince (as I may call him) and in reſpect of us, <hi>The firſt-begotten of many brethren;</hi> And herein is thy rejoycing, that the party offended is Chriſt's own Father, and, in Chriſt, thy Father; fathers cannot be cruel to their own dear children; <hi>What man amongſt you, whom if his ſon ask bread, he will give him a ſtone; or if he ask a fiſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 7.9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>will he give him a Serpent? If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</hi> and eſpecially if Chriſt himſelf ask?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider of the perſons for whom Chriſt intercedes, it is for all the Elect, and in particular for thee O the ſweet of this one meditation! if I knew that my name were written in Heaven, ſhould I not (as Chriſt bids me) <hi>rejoyce in this?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10.20.</note> oh but what is it to have my name written in the chief part of Heaven? what is it to have my name written in the breaſt-plate of Jeſus Chriſt? come, read O my ſoul, is it not thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Iſaac, or Jacob, I have prayed, and I am praying for thee that thy faith fail not?</hi> ſure I am that I would not part with my hope in the priviledge for all the wide world; the very conſideration of this makes me to eſteem of all the world as droſs, and dogs-meat. And oh that ever the world, or fleſh, or devil ſhould ſteal this meditation out of my heart! Oh that ever I ſhould forget that Chriſts is gone to Heaven, that he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Holy of Holies, and that he carries my name into the preſence of God the Father! I ſpeak the ſame to thee that readeſt, if thou art a Believer, there is no doubt of it, but Chriſt is ſpeaking a good word to his Father in thy behalf; he can no more forget thee in his interceſſions, than a Mother with full breaſts can forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her womb: Now if ever, <hi>look up to Jeſus,</hi> yea look, and never leave looking, till thou ſpieſt thy own name writ on his heart; it is enough to fix thy ſoul, and to make it dwell on Jeſus Chriſt thus carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee on his ſhoulders, and bearing thee on his breaſt plate for a memorial unto his Father in Heaven.</p>

No, no; he is a faithful and merciful High Prieſt; far above all the high Prieſts of
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:94897:237"/> the Old Teſtament; and if they were ſo careful not to leave out of their breaſt-plate one name of all the Twelve Tribes; how much more careful is Chriſt not to leave out thy name in his interceſſion? from this very Argument of Chriſt's compaſſion and Chriſt's faithfulneſs,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.1, 2.</note> the Apoſtle calls on us to <hi>conſider the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion Chriſt Jeſus, who was faithful to him that appointed him,</hi> above <hi>Aaron,</hi> or <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any of the <hi>high Prieſts;</hi> why, <hi>conſider him</hi> O my ſoul; this Goſpel-high Prieſt is well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy indeed of thy conſideration.</p>

O give me the interceſſions of Chriſt above all the interceſſions of Men or Angels.

I would be glad of the prayers of all the Churches of Chriſt; O that there were not a Saint on the earth, but that I were by name in his morning, and evening prayer (whoſoever thou art that readeſt, I beſeech thee pray for me); but above all, let me have a property in thoſe prayers and interceſſions that are proper only to Chriſt; I am ſure then I ſhould never miſcarry; Chriſt's prayers are heavenly, glorious, and very effectual.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider of the particulars wherein more eſpecially Chriſt's interceſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: Is it not in the preſenting of his perſon, blood, prayers, interpellations? is it not in the preſenting of our perſons, performances, pleas or anſwers to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of Sathan? men little think how buſie our Mediator, Sponſor, Solicitor, Advocate is now in Heaven for us; men little think that Chriſt is appearing, and his blood is crying, and his prayers are aſcending, and his robe of righteouſneſs is covering us, and the iniquity of our holy things: O my ſoul, <hi>look up,</hi> conſider Jeſus thy Saviour in theſe reſpects! I am perſwaded, if thou didſt but know, if thou couldſt but ſee, what a deal of work Chriſt hath in hand; and how he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it on for thy ſalvation, it would melt thy heart into very tears of joy. Whilſt Chriſt was on earth,<note place="margin">Luke 2.49.</note> and his Mother had loſt him, he could then ſay, <hi>Wiſt ye not that I muſt go about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> now Chriſt is in Heaven, he is about the ſame buſineſs ſtill; all his employment in Heaven is to intercede for us, that we may be ſaved: very true, there is much in this interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt; it is a Tree of many branches, and every branch fruitful; ſo that if thou wouldſt enlarge thy Meditation in this wide Ocean of delights, there is room enough; but herein I muſt leave thee in the duty, for I can but point at the ſeveral particulars whereon thou mayſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large: O think on it, that Chriſt, and Chriſt's blood, and Chriſt's prayers ſhould be all at work! that Chriſt ſhould play the Advocate, and plead thy cauſe, and perfume thy duties with his Incenſe; and take thy perſon in an unperceivable way to God his Father, and cry there, <hi>O my Father be merciful to this ſinner, pardon his ſin, and ſave his ſoul for the ſake of Jeſus:</hi> O bleſſed mediation! <hi>O bleſſed is the man,</hi> that on this bleſſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject knows how to <hi>meditate both day and night.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. Conſider of the power and prevalency of Chriſt's interceſſions with his Father. Is he not to this puropoſe a Prieſt to God, and called thereto by God? is he not the Son of God, yea, God himſelf? is he not God's Darling? God's Commander, as well as Petitioner? nay, is not the hand of God himſelf in this deſign? is not the Fathers heart as much towards us and our ſalvation, as Chriſt's own heart? as ſure then as Chriſt is gone into Heaven with thy name engraven on his heart, ſo ſure ſhalt thou follow him, and be with him where he is. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? who is he that condemneth?</hi> where Chriſt becomes Patron to defend againſt the ſentence of damnation, it is in vain for Sin, or Law, or Sathan, to attempt any thing: for as an innocent perſon is ſafe ſo long as he hath his learned Advocate to anſwer all Objections; ſo it is with Believers, who have Chriſt himſelf both
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:94897:237"/> Judge and Advocate; a ſure Advocate; he ever prevails in whatſoever he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes; he was never yet caſt in any ſuit; he hath for theſe Sixteen Hundred years carried away all the cauſes of hundreds, thouſands, and millions of ſouls; why, he is ſo dear and near to his Father, that he can work him to any thing he will: And O my ſoul, if thou haſt any relation to Jeſus Chriſt, is not here comfort; I dare in the Name of Chriſt be thy warrant, and give it under my hand, that if Chriſt pray for thee, Chriſt will be ſure to ſave thee; he never yet failed, he never will fail in any of his ſuits to God: Oh conſider of this!</p>

I ſhall not diſpute God's power, but if any will, let ſuch a one tell me what way could his own wiſdome have found out to heaven between the wrath of God, and the ſin of man? I believe it would have poſed all the wiſdom of the world (of Men and Angels) to have reconciled God's mercy in the ſalvation of man, and his juſtice in the condemnation of ſin; to have poured out hell upon the ſin, and yet to have beſtowed heaven upon the ſinner; now then, if God himſelf did ſtudy to find out this way, and that he hath ſaid, <hi>This is my pleaſure, that Chriſt my Son ſhall be a Prieſt, and that he ſhall offer himſelf, and Preſent himſelf and his offering, and his prayer to me for his People: O</hi> my ſoul reſt on this as the very ordination of God; admire at the contrivance of God; ſay, <hi>O the depth!</hi> queſtion no further, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meditate, and ponder, and conſider of it till thou feeleſt Chriſt's interceſſion darting its influence and efficacy on thy ſin-ſick ſoul.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. LEt us <hi>deſire after Jeſus</hi> carrying on this work of our ſalvation in his interceſſion. I cannot but wonder what a dulneſs ſeizeth on my heart, and on all the hearts of the Sons of men, that we have no more longings after Chriſt, whoſe heart is ever panting and longing after us. Surely we do not ſet our ſelves to find out experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the ſweetneſs that is in Chriſt; if there were not another object to think upon, but only this one of Chriſt's interceſſion, is not here enough to put us all into a teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing longing frame? <hi>O</hi> my ſoul, rouze up, and ſet this bleſſed object before thy face? take a full view of it untill thy affections begin to warm, and thou beginſt to cry, <hi>Oh for my part in Chriſt's interceſſion! Oh I would not be left out of Chriſt's heavenly prayers for ten thouſand worlds!</hi> come and be ſerious! the object is admirably ſweet and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; long for it, pant after it! God underſtands the Rhetorick of thy breathing, as well as of thy cry. But what is there in Chriſt's interceſſion that is ſo deſirable? I anſwer—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Chriſt's interceſſion lyes the preſent tranſaction of our ſouls ſalvation. Such paſſages as hitherto we have ſpoken of are done and paſt; the tranſactions of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, were at an end when time began; the tranſactions of Chriſt promiſed, had their period when Chriſt was incarnate; the tranſactions of Chriſt's Birth, and life and death, and reſurrection, and aſcenſion, are now above a thouſand and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old; I know the vertue and influence of all theſe tranſactions continue, and will continue for ever and ever, but the ſeveral actings had their periods; and only Chriſt's ſeſsion, and miſsion of his ſpirit, and his bleſſed interceſsion both were, and now are the very preſent imployment of Jeſus Chriſt. If it were poſſible that we could ſee into Heaven, if with <hi>Stephen</hi> we could look up ſteadfaſtly, and ſee the Heavens opened; if our eyes by an extraordinary power were carryed through that azure sky, and through all till we come to the Holy of Holies, and to Jeſus Chriſt in his glory; what ſhould we ſee but Chriſt interceding, Chriſt buſie with his Father in his poor Saints behalf? now he prayes, now he preſents his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, merits, interceſſion, interpellation, <hi>q. d. Father, here are a company of Rebels
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:94897:238"/> juſtly fallen under thy diſpleaſure, they deſerve to be ſet at an eternal diſtance from thee, but I muſt needs have them pardoned, and received into thy boſom; come, make thine own terms, let juſtice require never ſo great ſatisfaction, I have paid a price ſufficient for all, and effectual for them; give them what laws thou pleaſeſt, I will undertake they ſhall obſerve them; and to this purpoſe away, away holy ſpirit, go to ſuch and ſuch ſouls; enable them to their duties, yea, enable them in duty, and ſanctifie them throughout in ſouls; bodies and ſpirits.</hi> Why, this is the preſent tranſaction of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; methinks <hi>I</hi> long to know what Chriſt is now a doing in Heaven for my ſoul; and is it not thus, is not all his time ſpent either in reading pardons for his redeemed ones; or in preſenting petitions from them, and pleading for them. Surely he is ſtill inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding every day, it is his preſent work for our ſouls, O deſirable work!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this preſent tranſaction lies the application of all Chriſt's former actings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his habitual righteouſneſs, or of his active and paſſive obedience. All thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Chriſt's incarnation, conception, circumciſion, birth, life, and death, which more eſpecially we look upon, as the meritorious cauſes of our ſalvation, had been nothing to us, if they had not been applyed by Chriſt: they were the means of impetration, but Chriſt's interceſſion is the means of application: Chriſt purchaſed ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by thoſe precedaneous acts, but he poſſeſſeth us of our ſalvation by this perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and conſummate act of his interceſſion. The order of this is laid down by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.8, 9, 10.</note> in that firſt, <hi>He learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered,</hi> and then <hi>being made perfect, he became the Author</hi> (or applying cauſe) <hi>of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him;</hi> being to this purpoſe, <hi>called of God an High-Prieſt after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck.</hi> Now is not this the deſirable act above all other acts? Alas! what am I better for a Mine of Gold in ſuch, or ſuch, or ſuch a field, in which I have no propriety at all? I am throughly convinc'd that Chriſt's merits are moſt precious merits, but oh that they were mine! Oh that Chriſt's interceſſions would bring the ſalve, and lay it to my ſore! Oh that <hi>I</hi> could hear that voice from Heaven, <hi>My ſon, I was incarnate for thee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for thee, and born for thee, and circumciſed for thee, and I did the Law, and ſuffered the penalty for thee; and now I am interceding that thy very ſoul may have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all my doings, and of all my ſufferings.</hi> Why, if Chriſt's interceſſions be the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying cauſe, if it bring home to my ſoul all the former tranſactions of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>All theſe are thine, even thine,</hi> oh how deſirable muſt this interceſſion be?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In this application lies that communion and fellowſhip which we have with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son:<note place="margin">John 17.21.</note> 
                     <hi>I pray for theſe, that as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> Underſtand this ſoberly, we cannot think that there ſhould be that oneneſs in equalitie betwixt God and us, as betwixt God and Chriſt; no, no, but there is oneneſs in ſimilitude and reallity, even in this life; by vertue of Chriſt's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion we have oneneſs with God and Chriſt, not onely in comforts, but alſo in graces; I pray you mark this: when <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of communion with God in this life, I mean eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the communication of grace between God and the ſoul; on God's part there's a ſpecial influence of grace and favour to man; and on man's part, there is a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of grace and honour to God. Some trembling ſouls are apt to think, that all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God and Chriſt conſiſts only in the comforts of the holy ſpirit, whereas Chriſtians may as really and advantagiouſly have communion with God in ſecret convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of grace, inward ſupports, in a concealed acceptation of ſervice, in the hidden drawings of the ſoul God-ward, as in the more open, and comfortable manifeſtations of God unto the ſoul; communion with God is a familiar friendſhip (I ſpeak it in an holy humble ſence) now do we not as uſually go to a friend for councel and advice, as for comfort and cheering? in a friends boſom we intruſt our ſorrows as well as our joys. Suppoſe a ſoul even ſpiritually overwhelmed, and ready to break, be taking it ſelf unto God, and venting it ſelf before the Lord; now if afterwards the ſoul hath no more caſe, than by the bare lanching of the ſore, if God pours in no balm at all, but only gives ſupport; ſhall we ſay that this ſoul in this caſe hath no communion with God? O yes! in God's ſecret viſits of the ſoul, and in the ſouls reſtleſs groping after God, though nothing but darkneſs be apprehended, yet that ſoul lives in the light of God's countenance; the Sun ſhines, though a cloud interpoſeth; God ſmiles though the ſoul do not perceive it; or certainly thou haſt his ſtrengthening-ſupporting preſence, if not his ſhining;<note place="margin">John 17.23.</note> now this is the fruit of Chriſt's bleſſed interceſſion; and this is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter of Chriſt's interceſſions, <hi>O my Father, that theſe may be one in us; I in them, and thou in me; I in them by the influence and power of my Spirit, and
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:94897:238"/> thou in me by the fulneſs and power of the Godhead.</hi> And is not this a moſt deſirable thing?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In this communion lyes the viſion and fruition of Jeſus Chriſt in glory, grace brings to glory; If communion here, we ſhall have communion hereafter; and this alſo is a part of Chriſt's prayer and interceſſion, <hi>Father I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me may be with me where I am,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 17.24.</note> 
                     <hi>that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> Jeſus cannot be in Heaven long without his Saints; indeed it is impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould be in Heaven, and that pieces and bits of Chriſt-myſtical ſhould be in Hell, or yet long on Earth. Chriſt will draw in his Legs and Members on earth up nearer to the Head; certainly Chriſt and you that are believers muſt be under one roof ere long. Is not he gone before to prepare a place, yea, <hi>many manſions</hi> for you;<note place="margin">John 14.2.</note> we think them happy on earth that have their many ſtately Halls and Palaces; their ſummer, and their winter-houſes. O Chriſtians! how happy will you be when you come to be Lords and Heirs of many ſtately Manſions in the ſtreets of Heaven? but what ſpeak I of Manſions now I am naming Chriſt? Manſions are nothing, many Manſions are but little, yea, <hi>many Manſions in Chriſt's Fathers houſe,</hi> are but created chips of happineſs, in compariſon of that communion which by vertue of Chriſt's interceſſion we ſhall have with Chriſt. It is the ſaying of an eminently learned holy Divine,<note place="margin">Sam. Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſhould refuſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if Chriſt were not there; take Chriſt away from Heaven, and it's but a poor, dark, heartleſs dwelling; Heaven without Chriſt would look as the direful land of death.</hi> And therefore after Chriſt had ſpoke of many Manſions, and of a place that he would prepare for his Saints, he adds further to increaſe their joy,<note place="margin">John 14.3.</note> 
                     <hi>I will come again</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but as places of bryers and thornes without Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore I would have Heaven for Chriſt, and not have Chriſt for Heaven; O this communion with Chriſt is above all deſirable, and this is the ſubject-matter of Chriſt's prayer, <hi>Father I would have the Saints to be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi> Why, this is the communion which the Saints ſhall have with Chriſt, never will their eyes be off-him, never will their thoughts wander after any other objects; O the intimacy that will be then betwixt Chriſt and Chriſtians! Oh what communication of glory will there be to each other! <hi>Theſe ſhall walk with me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for they are worthy.</hi>

                  <p>O my ſoul, if this be the buſineſs of Chriſt's interceſſion, if all theſe particulars are contained in the bowels of this one tranſaction, how is it that thou art not in a fainting ſwoon? how is it that thou art not gaſping, groaning, ſick unto death with the vehement thirſt after thy part and portion in Chriſt's interceſſion? if there be ſuch a thing as the paſſion of deſire in this heart of mine, O that now it would break out! Oh that it would vent it ſelf with mighty longings, and infinite aſpirings after this bleſſed Object! why Lord I deſire, but help thou my faint deſires; blow on my dying ſpark, it is but little; and if I know any thing of my heart, I would have it more; Oh that my ſpark would flame! why Lord I deſire that <hi>I</hi> might deſire; Oh breath it into me, and I will deſire after thee.</p>

In this caſe we need not to aſcend up into Heaven to learn the truth, rather let us deſcend into our own hearts, and look whether Chriſt have given us of his ſpirit, which makes us cry unto God with ſighs and groans which cannot be expreſſed; he that will know whether the Sun ſhine in the Firmament, he muſt not climb into the clouds to look, rather he muſt ſearch for the beams thereof upon the earth; which when he ſees, he may conclude, that the Sun ſhines in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament: O come and let us ranſack our own conſciences; let us ſearch whether we feel the Spirit of Chriſt crying in us, <hi>Abba Father:</hi> certainly theſe two are as the cauſe and the effect; Chriſt's interceſsion in Heaven, and his Spirits interceſſion on earth are as twins of a birth; or rather ſuch is the concatenation of theſe two, that Chriſt's interceſſion in Heaven breeds another interceſſion in the hearts of his Saints.

<pb n="559" facs="tcp:94897:239"/> of Jeſus Chriſt? and if this preſence of Chriſt's Spirit be ſo ſweet, what is himſelf, then?</hi> I know we had need to be wary in laying down this ſign, it is clearly proved by an eminent Divine,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> of Aſſurance. Mat. 13.20. Mark 16.20. John 5.35.</note> that <hi>ſweet motions of heart in holy things are not infallible Evidences of grace:</hi> the third kind of hearers are ſaid to <hi>receive the Word with joy;</hi> they found ſome ſweet and power in the Ordinances of Chriſt; and <hi>Herod heard John gladly;</hi> and many <hi>for a ſeaſon rejoyced in John</hi>'s <hi>light and Miniſtry:</hi> Certainly affections in holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations with delight and joy, may be in thoſe, who yet have no true grace; ſo it may be that the novelty and ſtrangeneſs of a doctrine may much affect and delight; or the nature of the doctrine as it is comfortable, without any reſpect to ſpiritual operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may exceedingly affect; or the Miniſters abilities, becauſe of his parts, eloquence, elocution, affectionate utterance may much delight, and ſtir up the hearers affections; fine head-notions may produce ſome affectionate heart-motions; but what ſymptome of grace in all this? The ſign therefore I lay down of my propriety in Chriſt's interceſſions is not every ſweet motion, or every excited affection, but that which is holy, ſpiritual, heavenly, ſaving; I may diſcern much of this, if I will but look into the grounds and effects of my excited, or ſtirred up affections; if the ground thereof be fetched from Heaven, and in their effect they tend towards Heaven; if they wean my heart from the world; if they elevate and raiſe up my affections to things above; if they form, and frame my converſation heaven-wards, then may I be aſſured theſe motions and affections are of the right ſtamp; for all ſuch motions are but ſparks of that heavenly fire, the the flame whereof is mindful of its own original; they are the fruits of Chriſt, and they go back to Chriſt; they work towards their center, they tend towards the place from whence they came; and in this reſpect O that I could never hear a Sermon, without a ſavory affection of what I hear! O that I could never go to prayer without ſome warmth, and heat, and life, and fervency! Oh that in every duty I were ſavingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that I felt the ſavour of Chriſt's ointments, whoſe name, and whoſe interceſſion is as an ointment poured forth! in times of the Old Teſtament, if they offered up a ſacrifice, and a material fire came down from Heaven, and burnt up the ſacrifice to aſhes, it was a certain teſtimony that the ſacrifice was accepted: Now in the time of the Goſpel we muſt not expect material fire to come down upon our duties, but hath the Lord at any time cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. If in my heart I feel a holy frame, diſpoſition, inclination; to pray, and cry and intercede for others, eſpecially for the miſeries and diſtreſſes of the Church of God, then is Chriſt's interceſſion mine. We ſhould (as near as we may) in every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to Chriſt; and this conformity is an evidence or ſign to us of our intereſt in Chriſt: O my ſoul go down into the inmoſt cloſet of thy heart, look what diſpoſition there is in it towards the members of Chriſt; and thou mayeſt conclude, there is in Chriſt's heart the very ſame diſpoſition towards thee. Ah! do I think there is love in my boſom to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saints, and that there is no love in Chriſt's boſome towards me? what? can I think that my narrow, ſtraitened, ſinful bowels are larger than thoſe wide, compaſſionate, tender bowels of Jeſus Chriſt? as a drop of water is in compariſon of the Ocean, and as a gravel-ſtone is in compariſon of the ſand, ſo is my heart to Chriſt's, and my love to Chriſt's, and my bowels to Chriſt's.

Chriſt is ſo lovely, that the Saints cannot leave, but they muſt, and will <hi>follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes:</hi> there ſhall be no moment to all eternity, wherein Chriſt ſhall be out of ſight to ſo many thouſand thouſands of Saints; now this is the glory of the Saints above; as a Queen that ſees the Prince in his glory, ſhe delights in it, becauſe it is her glory; ſo the Church, when ſhe ſhall ſee Chriſt her Husband in his glory ſhe ſhall rejoyce in it, becauſe ſhe looks upon it as her own: Is not this a bleſſed end of Chriſt's interceſſion? why, hither tend all the reſt; all the other ends end in this; and for this above all Chriſt intercedes to his Father, <hi>Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 3.11.</note> 
                     <hi>I would have my Saints with me, O that all the daughters of</hi> Zion <hi>may behold King</hi> Solomon <hi>with the Crown wherewith thou haſt crowned him in the day of his Eſpouſals, and in the day of the gladneſs of his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only one Queſtion, and I have done; how ſhould I ſet my faith on work to act on Chriſt's interceſſion for theſe ends? I anſwer,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith muſt perſwade it ſelf that here is a vertue in Chriſt's interceſſion. Certainly every paſſage, and acting of Chriſt hath its efficacy, and therefore there is vertue in this; it is full of juyce, it hath a ſtrong influence in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith muſt conſider that it is the deſign of God, and the intendment of Chriſt, that this interceſſion ſhould be for the good of thoſe that are given to Chriſt. O there's enough in Chriſt, enough in Chriſt's interceſſion to convey communion, the Spirit, protection, free acceſs to the Throne of Grace, a Spirit of prayer, pardon of ſins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in grace, ſalvation of ſouls to the Saints, and people of God, through all the world; and this is the deſign of God, that Chriſt's interceſſion ſhould be as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whence all theſe ſtreams muſt run, and be conveyed unto us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith muſt act dependantly upon the interceſſion of Chriſt for theſe very ends, this is the very nature of Faith, it relyes upon God in Chriſt, and upon all the actings of Chriſt, and upon all the promiſes of Chriſt: ſo then, Is there a deſirable end in Chriſt's interceſſion which we aim at? O let us act our Faith dependantly; let us rely, ſtay, or lean upon Chriſt to that ſame end; let us roul our ſelves, or caſt our ſelves upon the very interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt: Saying, <hi>O my Chriſt, there is enough in thee, and in this glorious interceſſion of thine, and therefore there will I ſtick, and abide for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith muſt ever and anon be trying, improving, wreſtling with God, that vertue may go out of Chriſt's interceſſion into our hearts. <hi>I have heard Lord, that there is an Office erected in heaven, that Chriſt, as Prieſt, ſhould be ever praying, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding for his people: O that I may feel the efficacy of Chriſt's interceſſion! am I now in prayer? O that I could feel in this prayer, the warmth, and heat, and ſpiritual fire, which uſually falls down from Chriſt's interceſſion into the hearts of his! Lord warm my ſpirit in this duty; give me the kiſſes of thy mouth; O that I may now have communion with thee, thy Spirit upon me, thy protection over me! O that my pardon may be ſealed, my grace confirmed, my ſoul ſaved in the day of Jeſus!</hi> In this method, O my ſoul, follow on; and who knows but God may appear e're thou art aware? howſoever be thou in the uſe of the means, and leave the iſſue with God.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> Of loving Jeſus in that Reſpect.</head>
                  <p n="6">6. LEt us <hi>love Jeſus,</hi> as carrying on this great work of our ſalvation in his interceſſion. Now two things more eſpecially will excite our love. 1. Chriſt's love to us. 2. Our propriety in Chriſt. For the firſt, many acts of Chriſt's love have appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and every one is ſufficient to draw our loves to him again. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He had an eternal love to man; he feaſted himſelf on the thoughts of love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and free-grace to man from all eternity; ſince God was God (O boundleſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) the Lord Jeſus in a manner was loving and longing for the dawning of the day of the Creation; he was (as it were) with child of infinite love to man before he made the world. Some obſerve, that the firſt words which ever Chriſt wrote, were, <hi>Love to Believers:</hi> and theſe were written with glory, for it was before gold was, and they were written upon his boſom, for then other books were not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the beginning of time he loved man above all creatures, for after he had made them all, he then ſpeaks as he never did before, <hi>Let us make man in our image, after our likeneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> 
                     <hi>and let him have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattel, and over all the earth;</hi> and though man at that very inſtant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made himſelf by ſins, Chriſt's love yet was not broken off, but held forth in a promiſe till the day of performance, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head, and in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the fulneſs of time his love was manifeſted; the ſeed then bloſſomed, and the birth came out in an high expreſſion of love; the man-child, the love of Chriſt was born,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.4.</note> and ſaw the light. <hi>After that</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared.</hi> I ſhall not need ſure to inſtance in ſucceeding paſſages; ſo far as we have gone, we have clearly ſeen Chriſt's life was a perfect mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his love, as there is no beam in the Sun, in which there is no light, ſo there was no act in the life of Chriſt, but to a ſpiritual eye it ſhines with the light of love. But above all, O the love of Chriſt in his death! ask a Malefactor, if the Princes Son ſhould go to his Father, and ſay, <hi>Father, I confeſs this wretch hath deſerved to dye, but I ſee a willingneſs in thee that he ſhould live; only I perceive it ſticks with thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; why, for that, Father, here I am; and to ſatisfy thy juſtice I will dye my ſelf, only let this poor wretch live to the glory of thine, and my free grace.</hi> Ask (I ſay) the Malefactor what kind of love were this? Surely Chriſt dyed for our ſins, and Chriſt roſe again for our juſtification, and he aſcended, and ſate down at God's right hand, and ſent down his holy Spirit, and all for us; there was not one paſſage in all theſe tranſactions, but held forth the breakings and breathings out of a ſtrong fire of love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. At this time there is a coal of burning love in the breaſt of Chriſt: this fire was indeed from everlaſting, but the flames are as hot this day as ever; now it is that Chriſt loves, and lives; And wherefore lives? but only to love us, and to intercede for us. Chriſt makes our ſalvation his conſtant calling; he is ever at his work. <hi>Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to day, and for ever:</hi> there is not one hour in the day, nor one day in a year, nor one year in an age, wherein Chriſt is not buſie with his Father in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly imployment of interceding for us. He loved us before he died for us, his love being the cauſe why he died for us; and he loves us ſtill, in that now he intercedes for us: it is as much as to ſay, <hi>Chriſt hath loved us, and he repents not of his love:</hi> love made him dye for us, and if it were to do again, he would dye over again; yea, if our ſins had ſo required, that for every elect perſon Chriſt muſt have dyed a ſeveral death, Love, love would have put him willingly upon all theſe deaths; O the loves of Chriſt towards our poor ſouls! If I might but ſtay, and take ſome turns in this large Field of love: How many thouſands of particulars might I draw out of Scripture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Chriſt's love to us in this reſpect? though he be in Heaven, yet by vertue of his interceſſion, he bears us in his hands: yea, he leads us by the hand, and arms too. <hi>I taught</hi> Ephraim <hi>to go, taking them by their arms, but they knew not that I healed them;</hi> he dandles us on his knees,<note place="margin">Iſa. 40 11. Hoſ. 11.3. Deut. 32.11, 12.</note> he bears us on his wings; <hi>As an Eagle ſtirreth up her neſt, fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, and beareth them on
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:94897:242"/> her wings, ſo the Lord alone doth lead us;</hi> he carries us on his ſhoulders, as the man <hi>found his ſheep, and laid it on his ſhoulders rejoycing.</hi> Nay, I muſt yet come nearer,<note place="margin">Luke 15.5.</note> for Chriſt by his interceſſion ſets us nearer yet; <hi>His left hand is under us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and his right hand doth imbrace us;</hi> he wears us in Heaven, as a bracelet about his arms, which made the Spouſe cry out, <hi>O ſet me as a ſeal upon thine arm;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note> he ſtamps and prints us on the palms of his hands, <hi>Behold I have graven thee on the palms of my hands;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 49.16.</note> as if our names were written in letters of blood upon Chriſt's fleſh; he ſets us as a ſeal upon his heart, that is the expreſſion of the Spouſe too, <hi>O ſet me as a ſeal upon thine heart;</hi> Nay,<note place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note> ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the Saints to Jeſus Chriſt, that they lodge in Heaven in his bowels, and in his heart; for they dwell in Chriſt, <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 4.13. 1 John 4.16.</note> and they dwell in God, and dwell in love, <hi>For God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God.</hi> I know not what more to ſay; you know the manner of the high Prieſts, was to carry the names of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Holy of Holies on their ſhoulders, and on their breaſts: but was it ever heard, that any high Prieſt, beſides the great high Prieſt of our profeſſion, ſhould carry the names of thouſands, and millions on his ſhoulders, and on his arms, and on his hands, and on his wings, and on his boſom, and on his heart, nay in his heart, and in his bowels, as a memorial before the Lord? O unmatchable love!</p>
                  <p>Methinks this love of Chriſt ſhould now change my ſoul into a Globe or Maſs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love towards Chriſt, <hi>as it were by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Methinks a ſight of Chriſt in his preſenting himſelf, and his ſacrifice to his Father for me, ſhould ſo enamour my ſoul as that I ſhould delight in no other ſight but this; then is a Chriſtian ſweetly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, when as the golden Ball of Divine Love is toſſed to and again betwixt Chriſt's boſom and his; and in this reſpect it is a wonder that before this I am not ſickned, and overcome with love, and ready to cry out with the Spouſe, <hi>O ſtay me with flaggons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2.5.</note> 
                     <hi>and comfort me with apples, for I am ſick of love. O I am wounded with the arrows of love, ſo as neither grave, nor death, nor hell; neither Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come can ever lick theſe wounds, or enbalm, or bind them up. O my Chriſt, my Lord, my Jeſus, What ſhould I do but yield over my ſelf as a Spouſe under the power of her husband? what ſhould I do but loſe my ſelf in ſuch a deep Ocean of loves, ſtronger than wine, hotter than coals of</hi> Juniper, <hi>which hath a moſt vehement flame?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another motive of our love to Chriſt, it is our propriety in Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye are not your own,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle of us; and <hi>he is not his own,</hi> may we ſay of Chriſt: If any ask how may this be? I anſwer, That the ſoul in loving Chriſt is not her own, and in regard of loving, Chriſt is not his own; every one makes over it ſelf to another; and propriety or intereſt to it ſelf on both ſides ceaſeth: <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2.16.</note> ſaith the Spouſe; not as if Chriſt ſhould leave off to be his own, or to be a free God, when he becometh ours; no, no; but he ſo demeans himſelf in reſpect of his loves, as if he were not his own; he putteth on ſuch relations, and aſſumes ſuch offices of engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if he were all for us, and nothing for himſelf; thus he is called <hi>a Saviour, a Redeemer, a King, a Prieſt, a Prophet, a Friend, a Guide, an Head, an Husband, a Leader, Ranſomer, Interceſſor;</hi> and what not of this nature?</p>
                  <p>O my ſoul come hither, and put thy little candle to this mighty flame; if thou hadſt ten hearts, or as many hearts in one, as there are elected Men and Angels in Heaven and Earth, all theſe would be too little for Jeſus Chriſt: only go as far as thou canſt, and love him with that heart thou haſt, yea love him with all thy heart, and all thy ſoul, and all thy might; and as Chriſt in loving thee, is not his own, ſo let thy ſoul in loving Chriſt be not her own; Come, love thy Chriſt, and not thy ſelf; poſſeſs thy Chriſt, and not thy ſelf; enjoy thy Chriſt, and not thy ſelf; live in thy Chriſt, not in thy ſelf; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace thy ſelf in Jeſus Chriſt, not in thy ſelf; ſay with the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                     <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Certainly, if ever thou comeſt to love Chriſt truly, thou canſt not but deny thy ſelf, and all created lovers. This love will ſcrew up thy ſoul, ſo high above the world, and above thy fleſh, and above thy ſelf, and above all other lovers, that nothing on this ſide Chriſt, whether in heaven or on earth, will come in competition with him. Suppoſe a man in the top of a Caſtle higher than the third Region of the Air, or near the Sphere of the Moon, ſhould look down to the faireſt and ſweeteſt Meadows, or to a Garden rich with Roſes and Flowers, of all ſweet colours and delicious ſmells; certainly he ſhould not ſee or feel any ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pleaſantneſs, colour, ſmell, becauſe he is ſo far above them; ſo the ſoul filled
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:94897:243"/> with the love of Chriſt is ſo high above all created lovers, that their lovelineſs cannot reach or aſcend to the high and large capacity of a ſpiritual ſoul. O for a ſoul filled up with all the fulneſs of God! O for a ſoul ſtretched out to its wideſt capacity, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference for the entertainment of God!<note place="margin">Eph. 3.18, 19.</note> O my ſoul, that thou wert but <hi>able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with all the Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge!</hi> Surely if Chriſt be mine, if his death be mine, his reſurrection mine, his aſcenſion mine, his ſeſſion mine, his interceſſion mine, How ſhould I but love him with a ſingular love? farewel world, and worldly glory; if Chriſt come in room, it is time for you to vaniſh; I ſhall little care for a Candle when the Sun ſhines fair and bright upon my head: What? is my name written on the heart of Chriſt? doth he wear me as a Favour and Love-token about his arms and neck? is he at every turn preſenting me and my duties to his heavenly Father?<note place="margin">Cant. 4.9.</note> 
                     <hi>O thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my King, my Jeſus, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes, and with one chain of thy neck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſe, O my ſoul, thou hadſt been with Chriſt when he waſhed his Diſciples feet, and that he ſhould have come, and have waſhed thy feet; Would not thy heart have glowed with love to Jeſus Chriſt? why, Chriſt is now in glory, and now he takes thy filthy ſoul, and dirty duties, and waſhes (as it were) the feet of all, that he may preſent them to his Father; thou canſt not ſhed a tear, but he waſhes it over again in his precious blood, and perfumes it with his glorious interceſſions. Oh what cauſe haſt thou to love Jeſus Chriſt? Oh you that never loved Chriſt, come, love him now; and you that have loved Chriſt a little, O love him more: Above all, let me, O my ſoul, charge upon thee this duty of love; O go away warmed with the love of Chriſt, and with a love to Chriſt.</p>

A Chriſtians condition needs compaſſion, and Chriſt knows how much, and it is his work continually to lay it open above; <hi>O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thus, and thus it is with the Militant Church, not a Member in it, but he is under ſin and affliction; ſee here the tears, hearken to the ſighs, and groans, and chatterings, and mournings of my Doves below; I preſent here their perſons and performances; and oh that they may find acceptance through my merit!</hi> Some ſpeak of Heavens Muſick, ſome tell us of Saints and Angels ſinging and warbling in lively notes the praiſes of Chriſt in Heaven; and if any ſuch thing be, certainly, it is ear-tickling, heart-raviſhing muſick; O the melody, O the joy of Saints to hear ſuch heavenly ayres with heavenly ears! but be it as it will be, of this I am confident, that Heaven it ſelf yields no ſuch muſick as is the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt; this (if any thing in Heaven do it) makes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in the ears of God, and of all celeſtial Spirits, Saints or Angels: And (O my ſoul) ſuppoſe thy ſelf within the compaſs, if now thou couldſt but hear what thy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is ſaying in thy behalf: <hi>Is not this a brand newly pluck'd out of the fire? was not this poor ſoul but the other day in a ſtate of nature, defiled with ſin, within a ſtep of hell? and did not I ſend my Spirit to recall him? was not this precious blood ſhed for the redemption of him? and what though ſin ſtick and cleave to him to this day, yet have I not given thee charge to take away his filthy garments from him, and to cloath him with changes of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:94897:244"/> even with the ſhining robes of mine own righteouſneſs? O my Father, let this ſoul live in thy ſight! O caſt him not away for whom I have ſuffered, and done all this, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt ſatisfied without his ſociety, I am not right till he is with me in glory; he is my darling, my purchaſe, my portion, my delight, and therefore let him be ſaved.</hi> Is not this enough to cauſe thy very heart to leap in thy boſom? <hi>Bonaventure</hi> fondly reports, that <hi>Francis</hi> hearing an Angel a little while playing on an Harp, he was ſo moved with extraordinary delight, that he thought himſelf in another world. O but ſuppoſe thou ſhouldſt hear the voice of Jeſus thy Interceſſor thus pleading for thee, wouldſt thou not be caſt into an extaſie? would not this fill thee with joyes unſpeakable, and full of glory?—Come, realize this meditation? certainly if thou art Chriſt's, he is thus, or in ſome other manner interceding for thee; as ſure as Chriſt is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he is pleading with his Father in Heaven on thy behalf: O the joyes, the joyes, the joyes that I ſhould now feel!—Tell me, is it not a comfort, for a poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to be relieved at a rich man's door? we are all beggars in regard of Heaven, and Jeſus Chriſt doth not only come forth and ſerve us; but he takes us poor beggars by the hand, and leads us in to his heavenly Father: Oh what comfort is here!</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Let us pray or ſue our intereſt in this interceſſion: it is a queſtion amongſt the Schools, whether we may conveniently pray to Jeſus, to pray to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our behalf? And thus far is granted, that we may pray to Chriſt to make us partakers of his interceſſions, and to mingle our prayers with his prayers, that they may find acceptance with God his Father.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.6.</note> But that we may uſe ſuch a form, as <hi>ora pro nobis, O Chriſt pray for us,</hi> it is looked upon as inconvenient in this reſpect. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe cauſe <hi>we have no ſuch custom, neither the Churches of God.</hi> 2. Becauſe it favours too much of the error of <hi>Arrius, Neſtorius,</hi> and indeed of the Romaniſts themſelves. 3. Becauſe our prayers are moſt-what directed to Chriſt in his perſon or divine ſubſiſtence, whoſe part is rather to give, than to ask; or if they are directed to Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and not ſimply as the only begotten Son of God, then I ſee no incongruity (though in the former reſpect ſome inconvenience) but that we may pray to Chriſt to intercede for us; for ſo he is God and man; and he is conſidered according to both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; only the difference of both Natures is ſtill to be kept and maintained; interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the office of the whole perſon of Chriſt, and of the two natures of Chriſt. But he performs this office one way according to his Divine nature, and another way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humane nature. I liſt not to quarrel about niceties; it is thus agreed on all hands, and that is enough to our purpoſe, that we may call on Jeſus, or on God the Father in and through Jeſus, that Chriſt's interceſſions may be ours, and that he would make it out to us in a way of aſſurance every day more and more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us praiſe; let us bleſs God, and bleſs Chriſt for every tranſaction in Heaven for us. It is a wonder to obſerve what ſongs of praiſe were chanted to Chriſt in Heaven for that one tranſaction of opening the Book, and looſing the ſeven Seals thereof: firſt, <hi>The four beaſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 5.8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> and then <hi>the four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of the Saints, and they ſung a new ſong; ſaying, thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood.</hi>—And then <hi>the Angels round about the Throne, whoſe number was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands,</hi> came on, <hi>ſaying, worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing.</hi>— And then <hi>every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea,</hi> came on, <hi>ſaying, bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever; and the four beaſts, and four and twenty Elders fell down and worſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</hi> I cannot tell what other tranſactions may be in Heaven, we have but hints of them here, nor ſhall we fully or particularly know them till we come to Heaven; but
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:94897:244"/> for this one tranſaction of Chriſt's interceſſion, we cannot imagine leſs praiſe to be given to Chriſt than for any other; O then let us do this duty on earth, as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! what, is Chriſt praying for us? O let us be on the exerciſe of praiſing him; is Chriſt interceding for us? let us give him the glory of his interceſſion; Heaven is full of his praiſes, O why ſhould not earth ring with the ſound thereof? <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me, praiſe his holy Name.</hi>

                  <p n="9">9. LEt us conform to Jeſus in reſpect of his interceſſion. I cannot think but in every action of Chriſt there is ſomething imitable of us. And as to the preſent work, I ſhall inſtance only in theſe few particulars. As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt appears in Heaven for us; let us appear on earth for him. Is there not equity, as well as conformity in this duty? O my ſoul, conſider what thy Chriſt is doing, conſider wherein the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt conſiſts! is not this the firſt part of it? why, he appears in Heaven before Saints and Angels, and before God his Father in thy behalf; and art thou afraid to appear before worms, mortals, duſt and aſhes in his cauſe, or for his truth? ſhall Jeſus Chriſt own thee in Heaven? and wilt thou not own Jeſus Chriſt here in this world? ſhall Jeſus Chriſt, as thy great high Prieſt, take thy very name, carry it upon his breaſt into the preſence of God? and wilt not thou take the Name of Chriſt, and hold it forth in profeſſion and practiſe to all men? Oh what a mighty engagement is here to ſtand to Chriſt, and to appear for Chriſt, and to own his cauſe in theſe backſliding-times; in that Chriſt, who ſits at the right hand of God, is willing and ready to appear in perſon for us, both as a Mediator, and Sponſor, and Solicitor, and Advocate, and Leiger Embaſſador?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſpends all his time for us and our ſalvation, let us ſpend all our time for him, and in his ſervice; the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>He ever lives to make interceſſion for us;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> it is not for a day, or a month, or a year, but he lives for ever upon this account; for ever <hi>(i.e.)</hi> during all the time from his Aſcenſion until the end of the world; he is ſtill interceding; he ſpends of all that time for us, and ſhall we think it too much time to ſpend a few dayes that we have here to live upon the earth for him? one thinks this the greateſt Argument in the world to make us to walk cloſely with God in Chriſt; <hi>He ſpends of his eternity for us, and ſhall not we ſpend of our whole time for him?</hi> ſurely people do not think what Chriſt is doing in Heaven for them; if you who are Saints would but ſeriouſly conſider, that Chriſt this Sabbath, this day of reſt, is at his work, that without any wearineſs or intermiſſion from morning till evening, and from evening till morning he is ever, ever interceding; how would this engage you in his ſervice? Ah Chriſtians! if you ſhould continue praying, praiſing, reading, hearing all this day without any intermiſſion or breaking off. Oh what wearineſs! O how would you ſay, <hi>When will the day be done, when will the Sabbath be at an end?</hi> Well, but Chriſt is not weary of ſerving you; this Sabbath, and the laſt Sabbath, and the other Sabbath, and every Sabbath, when you had done your duties, he took your perſons, and duties, and preſented all unto his Father; he prayed over your prayers, and continued praying, and ſaying, <hi>Lord accept of a ſhort, poor, lean, imperfect ſervice done on earth for my ſake, and for thoſe merits ſake, which I am continually preſenting to thee here in heaven.</hi> Oh why do we not come up to this conformity? Oh why are we ſo uncomformable to the actings of Chriſt? he is preparing Manſions for us in Heaven, and are we digging in this world? he is making mention of our names to God, and are we ſinning againſt him and God? his blood cryes, <hi>O that theſe ſouls may be ſaved;</hi> and ſhall our ſins cry, <hi>It is juſt that theſe ſouls ſhould be damned?</hi> O mind the exemplar! Chriſt ſpends all his time for you, do you ſpend all your time for him: we cannot but judge this to be moſt equal, that <hi>they who live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him who ever lives to make interceſſion for them.</hi>

'tis our duty to put one another upon praying one for another, Chriſt intercedes for us, and ſo ſhould we intercede for his, called, or uncalled, if ſo they belong to the election of grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt takes our prayers, and mingles them with his own prayers, interceſſions, incenſe, and ſo preſents all as one work mingled together unto God the Father; O let this be our care to put up all our prayers to God in the Name of Chriſt, and to ſtay our ſelves upon the interceſſions of Chriſt; when all is done, let us beg the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our prayers, not for our ſakes, nor for our prayers ſake; but for his ſake, who perfumes our prayers, by interweaving them with his prayers. Many a poor ſoul is many time afraid to pray to God for want of the due conſideration of this conformity; ſuch a one goes to prayer, and he looks upon it as it lyes upon his own heart, or as it comes from himſelf, and then he cries, <hi>Oh what a poor, weak, ſinful, imperfect, impenitent prayer is this?</hi> well, but if this weak prayer of thine be once mingled with the glorious and heavenly prayer of Jeſus Chriſt, the weakneſs will ſoon vaniſh, and thy prayer will find acceptance with God the Father; it is with your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and duties as it is with your fire; your kitchin-fire is troubled with abundance of ſmoak, but if ever it could aſcend into the element of fire above, it would ſmoak no more; ſo your prayer while it lies upon your own hearth, there's a great deal of ſmoak in it, but if ever it get up into the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, there it is in its own element, and ſo it is freed from all its ſmoak, and ſo the weakneſs of it is done away. O conform to Chriſt in this point; he will not preſent thy prayers to God, but he will firſt mingle it with his own prayers; no more ſhouldſt thou preſent a prayer to God but in Chriſt's Name, conſidering that all thy prayers find acceptance in, for, and through the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. If it were not for this, I profeſs I knew not how to anſwer the cavils of our diſſolute adverſaries, who throw down prayers, as of no uſe at all; for us they object—</p>
                  <p>Thou canſt not pray (ſay they) by thy own confeſſion without ſome defect, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,<note place="margin">Object.</note> ſin: and if ſo, there is need of a new prayer, to beg pardon for the defects of that prayer; and then another prayer to heal the flaws of that prayer; and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do as much for that; and ſo in <hi>infinitum;</hi> by this means there would be an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite progreſſion without any ſtop at any prayer to all.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>I anſwer, This Objection were valid if there were no interceſſion of Chriſt to ſtay our ſelves, and our prayers on: but as we grant requeſts many times for ſome friends ſake, rather than for the parties ſake; ſo God doth alway grant requeſts for Chriſt's ſake, never for our own ſakes: Thou objecteſt there are many defects in our prayers as made by us: but I anſwer, there is no defects in the merits and interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, for whoſe ſake alone they are granted of God; and therefore our prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in Chriſt's Name, they may ſtay their heads in Chriſt's boſom; in this reſpect we need not ſtill to run our ſelves in a Circle, this being the laſt reſolution, <hi>Chriſt's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Chriſt's interceſſion.</hi> Chriſt offers up our perſons and wooden prayers in his golden Cenſer to his Father; Chriſt's interceſſion therefore is that which doth the deed.

<pb n="571" facs="tcp:94897:245"/> but becauſe Chriſt is ſo good, and his interceſſion for us is ſo good, that he neither can, not will take exception againſt him, or his interceſſion for us; and in this caſe Chriſt and Chriſtians make one perſon (as it were) in law; his interceſſion for us; and our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions for our ſelves, are but one interceſſion: and indeed he ſo mingles them that they ſeem but one, for <hi>the ſmoak of the incenſe, and the prayers of the Saints aſcend up together before God out of the Angels hand,</hi> Rev. 8.4.<note place="margin">Rev. 8.4.</note>

Mr. <hi>Aynſworth</hi> obſerves, that when things are done by a multitude; where one is chief, that the action is frequently aſcribed either to the multitude, or to him that is chief indifferently; as <hi>Jehoiadah brought forth the Kings Son, and he put the Crown upon him,</hi> 2 Kings 11.12. or <hi>they brought forth the Kings ſon, and they put upon him the Crown,</hi> 2 Chron. 23.11. ſo <hi>David offered burnt-offerings,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.17. or they offered burnt offerings, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.1. and ſo he <hi>ſhall deſcend with the voice of the Archangel;</hi> or <hi>he ſhall ſcend his Angels with a great ſound,</hi> Matth 24.3.</p>
                  <p>That there are ſeven principal Angels, Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> affirms; and that there is one which yet eminently, is called the Archangel; ſome others affirm, as among Devils, there is one chief Devil,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note> called <hi>the Prince of Devils;</hi> and therefore the fire is ſaid to be prepared for <hi>the Devil and his Angels;</hi> ſo from this Text of 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. and of <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13. and of <hi>Jude</hi> v. 9.

Heb. 2.2.</note> and the voice of a trumpet, is the voice of Thunder; <hi>And it came to paſs on the third day in the morning, there were thunders.</hi> In this ſenſe ſome expound theſe words of the Apoſtle, where the Law is ſaid to be <hi>ſpoken by Angels,</hi> becauſe the Angels did raiſe up thoſe extraordinary thunders, which happily were the matters of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate voice, in which the Lord ſpake to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> or if the Law was ſpoken by Chriſt (as I have delivered my opinion elſewhere) he being <hi>the Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>

<pb n="581" facs="tcp:94897:250"/> yet in reſpect of the voyce of thunders which attended on it; thus thunder is often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the voyce of God, and the voyce of his excellency,</hi> Job 37.4, 5. Pſalm. 29.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord ſhall deſcend <hi>with the trumpet of God.</hi> Such a voyce was uſed alſo at the giving of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18. and ſo it will be now when men are called to account for the keeping or breaking of it. For the underſtanding of this, our laſt tranſlation tells us,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.31.</note> that <hi>Chriſt ſhall ſend his Angels with the great ſound of a trumpet;</hi> but in four Greek copies, as <hi>Beza</hi> confeſſeth, as alſo in the Hebrew Goſpel of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in the Vulgar, and in the margent of our laſt tranſlation, it is read, that <hi>Chriſt ſhall ſend his Angels with a trumpet, and a great voyce.</hi> And ſo the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words are exegetical, <hi>q. d. with a trumpet,</hi> that is, <hi>with a great voyce, like the voice of a trumpet;</hi> ſo that this reading very provably proves, that the laſt trumpet is to be taken metaphorically. For the more full confirmation whereof I argue thus; when any thing is aſcribed to the Angels which is not ſuitable to their ſpiritual nature, and which they have no need of for the work they are about, is it to be taken meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically; unleſs the context or ſome other Scripture force us to a proper acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a material trumpet of Silver, Braſs, or the like metal, is not ſuitable to the ſpiritual nature of the Angels; neither have they need of ſuch a trumpet for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a great ſound in the Air; it is evident that without a trumpet they can make a great ſound like the noiſe of a trumpet; and there is nothing at all in the Scriptures that will force us, or probably lead us to a proper acceptation of the word; add yet to what hath been ſaid, that ſometimes a great voice is ſet out by the ſimilitude of a Trumpet; <hi>I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</hi> Rev. 1.10. and <hi>the firſt voyce which I heard, was as it were of a trumpet,</hi> Rev. 4.1.</p>
                  <p>But why is this ſound as of a trumpet, called <hi>the trumpet of God?</hi> I anſwer, for the greatneſs of it; for its uſual in the Hebrew Language for the ſetting forth of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, excellency, or ſuperlativeneſs of a thing, to add the Name of God to the word, whereby the thing is ſignified; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.6. <hi>A Prince of</hi> God, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> a Mighty Prince, Gen. 30.8. <hi>With the wreſtlings of</hi> God, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> with great wreſtlings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Mountains of</hi> God <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Great mountains, <hi>Pſal</hi> 80.10. <hi>Cedars of</hi> God <hi>(i.e.)</hi> very high Cedars.

                     <note place="margin">Exod. 19.16.</note> 
                     <hi>and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voyce of the trumpet exceeding loud, ſo that all the people that was in the camp trembled;</hi> and if there was trembling at the giving of the Law, oh what trembling will be at the general Aſſize, when ſinners ſhall be condemned for breaking of it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No ſooner the ſhout made, but the Saints ariſe; it is true, the Saints that are alive need no reſurrection, but upon them will this trumpet have its effect. Somthing like death ſhall ceaze upon them, and they ſhall be changed. The order of this is given in by the Apoſtle from the Lord; <hi>This we ſay unto you by the Word of our Lord,</hi>

                     <hi>that we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep, for the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then we which are alive and remain ſhall be caught up together with them into the clouds.</hi> The firſt that ſhall be called are the Saints that ſleep, and then the Saints that are alive ſhall be immediatly changed. Oh what a day will this be? what a ſtrange ſight to ſee all the dead ever ſince the beginning of the World riſe out of their graves? for the wicked I believe they ſhall riſe like Toads from their holes, in a black, ſwarthy, ugly, colour: A queſtion is amongſt the Schools, whether Reprobates ſhall riſe again with all their deformities which they had in this life? as ſome of them being blind, halt, lame, maimed, deaf, dum, &amp;c. Whether now they ſhall riſe in the ſelf-ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? for my part I conceive that whereas God the author of nature, will at that day reſtore humane nature, that therefore there ſhall be no defects of natural parts; certainly nothing ſhall be wanting in the damned, which may impede the ſenſe of torment in any part; now a defect of any member would hinder theſe univerſal torments that muſt ceaze on every part of the bodies of the damned in Hell; their bodies therefore ſhall be whole, onely the bodies of ſuch ſhall be foul, ugly, heavy, lumpiſh bodies, as oppoſed to the glorious qualities of the bodies of Saints; why, what bodies (you will ſay) have they? <hi>I</hi> anſwer, glorious bodies: no ſooner ſhall the bodies of the Saints ariſe, but they ſhall exceed with ſingular

                     <hi>They were ſown in corruption, but they are raiſed in incorruption; they were ſown in diſhonour, but raiſed in glory; they were ſown in weakneſs, but raiſed in power; they were ſowen natural bodies, but raiſed ſpiritual bodies.</hi> The Sun in its ſhinings, doth but ſhadow forth the glory of their bodies; and this will in ſome meaſure torment Reprobates, to ſee the difference of their bodies, and the bodies of the Saints. O (will they ſay) yond are they, whom we deſpiſed, and now are they honoured. See a world of Suns riſing at once out of all parts of the Earth; ſometimes we lived on Earth, and we never ſaw but one Sun riſing in the Eaſt, but lo millions of Suns on Eaſt, and Weſt, and North, and South; O thoſe are the glorious Saints of Heaven: ſee with what ſwift and agile bodies they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to fly into the Air, to meet their Lord and Saviour there; whilſt in the mean time we riſe with ſuch heavy, dull, and deformed bodies, that we cannot mount. O what will become of us? why this is the day of reſurrection. The Angels have been here to unſeal our graves to roll away the ſtones, and at their ſhout, and ſound of the Trumpet, our ſcattered duſts have met together: and lo now we ſtand upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. No ſooner the Saints raiſed, and their ſouls and Bodies re-united with excellent Majeſty, but then ſhall all the elect of God, from firſt to laſt be gathered together: if you ask whence? and whither? I anſwer—</p>

                  <p n="4">4. FOR Chriſt and the Saints meeting at the judgment day; no ſooner are the Saints lifted up, and ſet before the Judge, but theſe things follow—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They look, and gaze, and dart their beams: and reflect their glories on each other. Oh the communications! Oh the darting of beams betwixt Chriſt and his Saints! look as when two admirable perſons, two lovers meet together, their eyes ſparkle, they look on, as if they would look through one another. So Chriſt and his Saints at firſt meeting, they look on, as if they would look through one another. And ſuch is the effect of theſe looks, that they give a luſtre to each other by their Looks. Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> face ſhine when he had been with God? and ſhall not the faces of the elect glitter and ſhine when Chriſt alſo looks on them? nor ſtays it there; but as they ſhine by Chriſt, ſo ſhall their ſhine reflect on Chriſt, and give a glory to Chriſt, and this I take it to be the meaning of the Apoſtle, <hi>That when Chriſt ſhall come,</hi>

                     <hi>he ſhall be glorified in his Saints;</hi> not onely in himſelf, but in his Saints alſo; whoſe glory as it comes from him, ſo it redounds alſo to him, <hi>For of him, and through him,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.13.</note> Though Stars may loſe their ſhining when the Sun ariſeth, yet the glory of the Saints ſhall be no leſs, becauſe of the Sun of righteouſneſs, but rather more. This is the day that Chriſt ſhall honour his Saints before all the world; come (will he ſay) and ſit you down at my right hand; as a Shepheard divideth his Sheep from the Goats, ſo will I ſeparate you from wicked reprobates; why you are they for whom the eternal councels of my Father did work, you are they in whom I am now to be gloryfied for ever; and therefore now will I exalt, and advance, and honour you; ſit here, or ſtand here on my right hand: O come, come hither to the right hand of your Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Hereupon Chriſt fully, and actually joys in them; and they in him; he joys in them, becauſe now he ſees of the travail of his ſoul; he ſees the iſſue of all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſufferings hereon earth, he ſees now the great work he hath brought about, to wit, the glory of his Saints; and he cannot but rejoyce therein. As a man that makes a work that is very curious, and glorious, he takes abundance of delight to look upon it; when God made the world; he lok't upon what he made, and he ſaw it was good, and he delighted in it: So Chriſt looks on his Saints, and when he ſees what he hath done, in raiſing ſo poor a worm to ſo high an excellency, he takes infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein; now he ſees that he hath attained his end in that great deſign, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt councels that he had before the world: he was then reſolved to ſave a number of ſinners, and to bring them at laſt to himſelf that they might behold him in his glory, and manifeſt the riches of his grace; and to that purpoſe hath he ſtill been carrying on the great work of ſouls ſalvation, as we have heard; and now that he ſees it accompliſhed, and fulfilled in them, he muſt needs delight:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.17.</note> 
                     <hi>In that day it ſhall be ſaid to Jeruſalem, fear thou not, and to Zion, let not thy hands be faint, for the Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty, he will ſave thee, he will rejoyce over thee with joy, he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi>

                  <p>And as he joys in them, ſo they cannot but rejoyce in him; as he delights in their glory, ſo they cannot but delight in his glory: are they not at Chriſt's right hand? and is not that the place of pleaſure, the Paradiſe of God?<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11.</note>

The Book muſt be opened. <hi>And I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God, and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened which is the Book of life.</hi> It is ſpoken after the manner of men, in whoſe publick Judgments are produced all the writings of the proceſs, informations, depoſitions of witneſſes, to ſhew that all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 20. de civitate Dei, cap. 14.</note> even the moſt ſecret ones, ſhall then be rehearſed and made manifeſt; <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinks theſe Books to be the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, wherein all things either to be done, or omitted, are preſcribed by God: and then ſhall theſe Books be opened,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.16. <hi>Orig.</hi> Com. ad Rom. 14.</note> becauſe according to them ſhall ſentence be given; <hi>In that day</hi> God <hi>ſhall Judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus</hi> Chriſt <hi>according to my Goſpel. Origen,</hi> and all moſt all with him, think theſe Books to be the Books of our conſciences, which now are ſhut up, and concealed from men; but then ſhall be made manifeſt to all the world: whatever theſe Books are, we find here one Book opened which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Saints, called <hi>the Book of Life;</hi> This Book contains in it the names of all that are elected from firſt to laſt; Thou <hi>John,</hi> and thou <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and thou <hi>Judeth,</hi> and thou <hi>Mary,</hi> and thou <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp;c. you are all Book'd down; there is the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and there is the certainty; <hi>Your names are written in Heaven, rejoyce in it;</hi> Oh what is the joy of Saints when once they ſee this book opened, and their names inrolled, engraven there in letters of glory. This very Book clears it to me, that God from all eternity made choice of a particular and determinate number of Perſons, to ſave them; and that none other can be ſaved, but thoſe who were ſo elected; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are ſo elected,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.8. — 17.8.</note> they ſhall not fall away. <hi>All that worſhip the Beaſt, their names are not written in the Book of life of the Lamb, from the foundation of the world.</hi> On the other ſide,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be written in the Book of life, and I will not blot out his name, but I will confeſs his name before my Father and before his Angels.</hi> This is the day when that book of life ſhall be opened, and Chriſt ſhall read the names of every elect perſon before God and Angels; not that Chriſt needs a book, or indeed reads a name, but that his Election ſtands ſo firm, that he knows every predeſtinated Saint as well, as we know their names, whom for our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we commit unto our books: and then he will ſo honour his Saints, that he will publiſh their names to all the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the actions, demeanours, graces, duties, and (it may be) ſins of Saints ſhall be produced and laid open: the holy Ghoſt tells us, that <hi>the dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the Books.</hi> It appears hence, that not onely names, but things were written, and theſe things were produced, and accordingly they were judged.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to evil things, unfruitful works of darkneſs. It is a queſtion, and I dare not be too poſitive in it, <hi>viz. Whether the ſins of God's People ſhall be manifeſt at the day of Judgment?</hi> Some are for the negative, becauſe God in his promiſes ſpeaks ſo expreſly,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.25. —44.22.38.17. John 5.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Of forgiving iniquities, of remembring them no more, of blotting them out, of throwing them into the bottom of the Sea, of caſting them behind his back:</hi> in which reſpect ſay they, the Godly are ſaid <hi>not to come into Judgement.</hi> I ſuppoſe this laſt Text is ill urged, for by Judgment is not meant diſcuſſion, but condemnation; and in our beſt Tranſlations ſo it is rendred; others are for the affirmative, upon theſe grounds. 1. Becauſe many of the Godly and wicked men's ſins are mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and there cannot be a Judgment of diſcuſſion, preceding that of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, unleſs Godly men's ſins are alſo produced. 2. Becauſe it is ſpoken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in reſpect of all ſorts, that <hi>the Books were opened;</hi> By which Books moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the conſciences of men, and by the opening of thoſe Books, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the manifeſting, clearing, and diſcovering of conſciences at that general day.</p>

                     <pb n="587" facs="tcp:94897:253"/>3. Becauſe the Scriptures are expreſs for the affirmative; not but that thoſe Texts are truths, that <hi>ſins are forgiven, blotted out, thrown away, to be remembred no more, (i.e.)</hi> as to condemnation; but as for exploration or diſcuſſion the Lord ſpeaks univerſally, that <hi>of every idle word that men ſpeak,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 12.36.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſhall give an account thereof at the day of Judgment.</hi> If the ballance weigh down on this ſide (for my part I am not peremptory, but ſhall eaſily ſubmit to the ſpirits of the Prophets) yet this manifeſtation ſhall not be for the ſhame, grief, trouble, ignominy, or confuſion of the godly; but only for the ſetting up of God's juſtice, and that the goodneſs and free grace of God in Chriſt may be made more illuſtrious; how will Chriſt then be exalted, when all the world ſhall ſee his righteouſneſs and goodneſs, his truth and mercy, now again meeting together, and kiſſing each other? it was ſo at his firſt coming, and it will be ſo at his ſecond coming; then ſhall his juſtice and mercy, his righteouſneſs and goodneſs be manifeſted to all; in that by his own merits, notwithſtanding their ſins, he will bring all his Saints to his heavenly glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for good things, whether good works, duties or graces, there is no queſtion but all theſe will be that day produced, and laid open. 1. We ſee Chriſt enumerating <hi>the good works</hi> of them on his right hand; for <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 25.35, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>and ye cloathed me; ſick, and ye viſited me; in priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi> It is true, in this catalogue we find nothing of faith, but all of works; but certainly faith is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as the life of the Tree is included in the fruit; not only, nor principally are works here mentioned for the goodneſs of the work conſidered in it ſelf; but as theſe works did expreſs our faith and love to Jeſus Chriſt, in that by ſaith we could ſee Chriſt in a poor beggar, or priſoner, and could love Jeſus Chriſt in theſe poor, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all our worldly goods, or liberties. I do not wonder that <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth his Corinthians, <hi>See that ye abound in this grace</hi> of contribution to the Saints:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.7. Phil. 1.9. 1 Theſ. 1.12.</note> and that he prayeth his Philipians, <hi>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more;</hi> And that he prayeth for his Theſſalonians, <hi>now the Lord</hi> make you to increaſe, and to abound in love one towards another, and towards all men; and that he praiſeth God in their behalf; <hi>We are bound to thank God always for you brethren, as it is meet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth.</hi> Chriſtians! if we did but conſider that every duty done to God or Man, that every penny given to a poor naked Saint, that every cup of cold water given to a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, ſhould not loſe his reward, but this day ſhould be reckoned up, or drawn (as it were) into a full Inventory; <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, For this piece of ſilver given ſuch a day to ſuch a one;</hi> Item, <hi>For this piece of bread ſuch a day given to ſuch a one,</hi> &amp;c. Oh who would not abound in faith and love? oh who would think any thing too much, too good, too dear to give to the needy members of Jeſus Chriſt? there is a charge laid upon Miniſters to preach this Doctrine, I beſeech you give me leave to diſcharge my duty, and to lay it, and leave it at your doors, where beggars uſually ſtand;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17, 18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world—that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to deſtribute, willing to communicate; laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi> You to whom God hath given the riches of this world, as you would meet Chriſt with comfort, learn this leſſen; conſider whether of theſe too reckonings will be more comfortable at that day; <hi>Item,</hi> So much given to ſuch and ſuch a religious uſe? or ſo much given towards ſuch a Feaſt, and for the entertainment of ſuch brave gallants? ſo much to promote the Goſpel? or ſo much at Dice, Cards, Horſe-races? if one ſhould tell you, that either you muſt feed Chriſt in the poor, or you muſt ſtarve in Hell; you muſt either cloath naked Chriſt in the poor, or you muſt be laid naked to the fiery indignation of the Lord for ever, oh what ſtrictneſs would you call this? but I recollect my ſelf; if Chriſt ſet you at his right hand, he will then recount all your charities, and all your labours of love to the Saints: you that are poor, and had nothing to give, he will tell you of your good works, if it was no more, but at ſuch a time, you caſt a mite into his Treaſury, and at ſuch a time you carried a Letter for the Lord Jeſus; he will produce and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe pittances of your poor charities to all the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor only good works to man; but all the Saints duties to God ſhall come in remembrance. Oh then it will be known who ſerved the Lord in ſpirit and truth, and who did not; then Men and Angels ſhall know, <hi>ſuch a day this poor
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:94897:254"/> Saints performed ſuch a ſpiritual ſervice;</hi> every prayer in publick or private, every, tear ſhed for ſin, every ſob, or ſigh, every ſpiritual meditation, or ſelf-examination every glance, ejaculation, or <hi>looking unto Jeſus,</hi> ſhall be recounted by Jeſus: It was ſaid of <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 10.4.</note> that as well <hi>his prayers to God,</hi> as <hi>his alms</hi> to men <hi>came up for a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial before God;</hi> certainly every duty in reference to the firſt table is booked in Heaven, and at this day the book being opened, it will appear, that ſuch a prayer thou madeſt ſuch a morning and ſuch an evening in thy cloſet;<note place="margin">Mat. 6.6.</note> and now will Chriſt ſay, <hi>Did not I tell thee, that if thou wouldſt pray to thy Father in ſecret, then he that ſaw thee in ſecret, ſhould reward thee openly? why now ſhalt thou have thy reward in a full view, I will divulge here all thy ſecret duties, to Men and Angels; all the world ſhall know it, thy wandrings I told them,</hi>

Nor onely duties, but graces ſhall now be rehearſed; thy Knowledge, Faith, Hope, Love, ſpiritual Joy; thy Fear, Obedience, Repentance, Humility, Meekneſs, Patience, Zeal, Perſeverance ſhall be fully diſcovered; time was that in the incenſe of ſuch a Prayer many ſweet ſpices were burned together; therein was Faith working by Love; therein was Humility, therein was Patience in ſubmiting to God's will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, therein was Hope of a gracious anſwer in God's due time, therein was Holineſs, brokenneſs of Heart,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.1.</note> and love to others, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p n="1">1. Of ſins: <hi>Come</hi> (will Chriſt ſay) <hi>Now confeſs all your ſins before all the world;</hi> time was that you conſealed your ſins, but now every ſin ſhall be laid open before God, Angels, and Men; and now is the black Book of their conſciences opened, wherein appears all their ſins original and actual; of Omiſſion and Commiſſion. For omiſſions of duties all thoſe ſhall be diſcovered. <hi>Chriſt hungry, and I gave him no meat; Chriſt thirſty, and I gave him no drink; Chriſt a ſtranger, and I lodged him not; Chriſt naked, and I cloathed him not;</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſick, and in priſon, and I viſited him not.</hi> And for commiſſions of evils, all thoſe ſhall be diſcovered. <hi>Theſe and theſe ſins I committed in my child-hood, youth, ripe age, old age: theſe were my groſs ſins, Blaſphemy, perjury, Idolatry, robbery, drunkenneſs, uncleaneſs, prophaneneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and theſe were my leſs ſins, anger, hatred, envy, diſtruſt, impatience, pride, preſumption, contention, deriſion, inconſtancy, hypocriſie,</hi> &amp;c. Oh the numberleſs number of evil thoughts, words and deeds that now are laid open. In the black book is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written all ſins done, but all ſuch ſins as were intended and purpoſed to be done; All the projects of the heart, though never acted, muſt now be diſcovered. Men little think of this; if I ſhould tell you of ſuch deſigns that died in your hearts, and never came out to light; you would be now ready to ſay, <hi>Tuſh, I never did ſuch a thing, I onely intended it, or had ſome thoughts about it, and what then?</hi> why then thoſe very thoughts, ſecrets, purpoſes, projects ſhall come to light; or if there be any thing more hidden or ſecret, as the very bent, and frame of your hearts, the very inclinations of your ſouls to this or that evil, ſhall then be manifeſt to all the World. Nay, yet more, ſuch ſins, as by the ſinners themſelves were never took notice of, either before, or at, or after the commiſſion of them, ſhall this day come out. Conſcience is ſuch a kind of private Notary or Secretary, that it keeps notes or records of all acts and deeds, whether you obſerve them or no; conſcience hath the Pen of a ready Writer, and takes in ſhort-hand, and in an illegible character,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:94897:256"/> from your mouths as faſt as you ſpeak, and from your hearts as faſt as you contrive. <hi>Conſciences writing</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>is not now legible; as that which is written with the juice of a Lemmon is not to be read by day-light, but againſt the ſire by night you may read it; ſo conſciences writing cannot now be read, but in that day when Heaven and Earth are ſet on fire, this book ſhall be opened, and the cypher be diſcovered.</hi> Oh what a day will this be, when not a ſin committed by any reprobate from the beginning of the world, but now it ſhall be rehearſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As an account of all ſins, ſo an account of all temporal gifts which God hath imparted to reprobates, muſt now be given. Some have the gifts of the world; as riches, honours, places of authority; others have the gifts of the body, as health, ſtrength, beauty, life; others have the gifts of the mind, as underſtanding, wiſdom, policy, learning; now of all theſe gifts they muſt give an account. Come you that are rich (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>render you an account of your ſtewardſhip; how have you ſpent your riches?</hi> The like will he ſay to the honourable, and to thoſe in places of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>Oh remember you were in authority, and office, and place, but what ſervice did you to me, or my members? you had wiſdom, and learning, and knowledg, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conferred upon you, but what good had the Church or Common-Wealth by it?</hi> the like will he ſay to others according to the talents beſtowed on them, <hi>You excelled in ſtrength, beauty, health of body, length of days; and now tell me, and publiſh it to all the world, how were theſe improved?</hi> I believe many a ſad anſwer will be given to Chriſt of theſe things, riches miſ-ſpent, and health miſ-ſpent, and wiſdom, policy, learning, gifts, and parts miſ-ſpent; O conſider it! if the Factor after many years ſpent in forreign Countries, at laſt returns home without his reckonings, who will not blame him for his negligence? but when his Maſter calls him to account, and he finds nothing but a bill of expences, this in courting, that in ſeaſting: who laughs not at ſo fond a reckoning? Thus many paſs the time of their life as a time of mirth, then when they return to their Lord again, behold all their accounts are ſins, their profits vanities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſhall add one thing more; not onely of gifts Temporal, but of all bleſſings ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, though but tendred, and offered, muſt all give an account. Oh the ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that many a ſoul will make of theſe things! methinks I hear ſome wicked wretch confeſſing thus to Chriſt; <hi>True Lord, I lived at ſuch a time when the Sun of the Goſpel ſhone bright in my face; and in ſuch a place where all was Goſhen; I lived under ſuch a miniſtery, who ſet before me life, and death; many and many a powerful, and ſearching Sermon have I heard; any one paſſage whereof (if I had not wickedly and wilfully forſaken my own mercy) might have been unto me the beginning of the new Birth, and everlaſting bliſs. Sometimes in the uſe of the means I felt ſtirrings or ſtrong workings in my heart, and then I was fully purpoſed to have been another man, to have cleaved to Chriſt, and to have forſook the World; I was almoſt reſolved to have been wholly for God, I was almoſt perſwaded to be a real Chriſtian; Oh what thoughts were in my heart when ſuch a faithful Miniſter preſſed the truth home? methinks every Sermon I heard then, is now a preaching again; methinks I hear ſtill the voice of the Minister, methinks I ſee ſtill his tears dropping down his cheeks; Oh how freſh is the reproof, admonition, exhortation of ſuch, and ſuch a Preacher now in my mind? oh how earneſtly did he intreat me! with what love and tender compaſſion did he beſeech me: how did his bowels yearn over me! how ſtrongly did he convince me, that all was not well with my ſin-ſick ſoul! how plainly did he rip up all my ſores! and open to me all my ſecrets, and my whole heart! but alas within a while I made a jeſt of all,</hi> I <hi>hardened my heart againſt all,</hi> I <hi>ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled all his convictions, I ſhut my eyes againſt his diſcoveries; I cared neither for the Miniſter, nor any thing he ſaid, or did. And yet here is not all, not onely the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, but the Spirit of Chriſt ſometimes ſpeak to my heart; I remember at ſuch a time Chriſt himſelf (as it were) condeſcended, and bowed the Heavens, and came down to intreat me for my ſouls health; oh the ſtrivings of the Spirit of Chriſt, as if he had been loath to have took a denial!</hi>

                     <hi>O Chriſt, I remember thy words, when thou cryedſt to me, open ſinner, open thy heart to thy Saviour, and I will come in, and ſup with thee, and thou with me. Why ſinner, are thy luſt's better than I? thy carnal pleaſures better than I? thy worldly commodities better than I? why ſinner, what doſt thou mean? how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? O take pity on thy Jeſus! for here I ſtand, and wait at the door of thy heart, and my head is filled with the dew, and my looks with the drops of the night. But Alas! I reſiſted Chriſt and his Spirit; O thou Judge
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:94897:256"/> and Saviour of all thine Elect, I dealt churliſhly with thee, I tyred out thy patience, I gave thee a repulſe, I told thee I had entertained other lovers, and I would have none of thee; I troad on councel, I trampled thy precious blood under my feet; and now I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting no other but to eat the fruit of my own way. Now mayſt thou accompliſh thy Word, becauſe I ſet at naught all thy counſels, and would none of thy reproof, therefore thou mayſt laugh at my calamity, and mock now my fear cometh.</hi> Lo, here the confeſſions of ſins. Every thing now comes out, for Chriſt will have it ſo, as a preparative to his doom upon them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Chriſt and his Saints proceed to ſentence. Firſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note> Chriſt the chief Judge ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, <hi>depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> every word breathes out nothing but fire and brimſtone, vengeance and wo; to <hi>depart</hi> from that glorious preſence of Chriſt were Hell enough, but they muſt go with a <hi>curſe;</hi> nor only ſo, but into <hi>fire;</hi> and that muſt be <hi>everlaſting;</hi> and therein they ſhall have no other company or comforters but wicked devils, and they inſulting over them with helliſh ſpight and ſtinging exprobations.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave a little to enlarge upon theſe words. No ſooner Chriſt begins the ſentence, <hi>Depart from me]</hi> but methinks I imagine the reprobates to reply; how? depart from thee? why O Chriſt, thou art all things, and therefore the loſs of thee is the loſs of all things; thou art the greateſt good; and therefore to be deprived of thee is the greateſt evil; thou art the very Centre, and perfect reſt of the Soul, and therefore to be pulled from thee is the moſt cruel ſeparation: we were made by thee, and for thee, O let us never be divided from thee; we were made according to thy Image, O never drive us from our glorious pattern; <hi>Away, away</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) ye have no part in me, or in my merits, never ſpeak, or intreat me any more, but <hi>depart from me.</hi> But ſecondly, they may reply again, if we muſt depart, and depart from thee, at leaſt give us thy bleſſing before we go, thou haſt great ſtore of bleſſings to give, and we hope thou haſt one yet in ſtore for us, we crave but a ſmall thing, but a bleſſing. <hi>O it is a little one;</hi> thou art our Father (witneſs our Creation) and it is a chief property of a Father to bleſs his children. No, <hi>depart from me ye Curſed, in place of a bleſſing take the full curſe of your Father, you have been moſt prodigal and diſobedient children: you have followed him who had my firſt curſe; and now ſhare ye curſes with him, curſed be you in your ſouls, and in your bodies; and in your thoughts, and in your words, and in the hainouſneſs of your ſins, and in the grievouſneſs of your puniſhment.</hi> But thirdly, if we muſt depart from thee, and depart accurſed, yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point us ſome meet and convenient place to go into; Create a fruitful piece of ground, and let a goodly Sun daily ſhine upon it; let it have ſweet and wholſome air, and be ſtored with fruits, and flowers, of all formes and colours; give us the variety of Creatures for our uſes; O if we muſt go from thee, the ſource and fountain of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſweetneſs, and afford us ſome plenty of earthly pleaſures, which may in ſome ſort recompence our pain of loſs, ſpeak but the word, and ſuch a place will preſently ſtart up, and ſhew it ſelf. <hi>No, depart from me ye curſed into fire; though fire natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally burns not Spirits, yet I will lift and elevate this fire above its nature; you have ſinned againſt nature, and I will puniſh you above nature;</hi> Fire? alas that ever we were born! who is able to reſt in fire? the very thought of it already burns us. Of all the creatures appointed by God to be the Inſtruments of revenge, fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have the leaſt mercy. But Fourthly, if we muſt into fire, let the ſentence ſtand but for a very ſhort time; quench the fire quickly, half an hour will ſeem a great while there; <hi>No, depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire; it was kindle by my breath, and it hath this property among other ſtrange qualities, that it is an unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fire; as long as I am God it ſhall endure, and ye broyl in it; and when I ceaſe to be happy, then ſhall ye ceaſe to be miſerable.</hi> O wo is us! what? to live in a fire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually without all end, or hope of end?—Yea Fifthly, allot us then ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters, whoſe ſmooth and gentle words may ſweeten our torments, or ſomewhat dull the moſt keen edge of our extremity: O let the Angels recreate us with Songs and hymns of thee, and of thy bleſſedneſs, that we may hear that ſweetly delivered which others fully enjoy: <hi>No, no; depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Devil and his Angels: they ſhall be your comforters, they that will triumph in your miſeries, they that are your deadly, deſperate enemies; they that will tell you by what deceits and by-ways they led you from me, and that will give you every hour new names of ſcorn and horrible reproach.</hi> O ſentence not to be endured, and yet never,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:94897:257"/> never muſt it be reverſed. O my brethren, I tremble at the very mentioning of this ſentence, and O what will they do on whom it muſt paſs? I beſeech you before we paſs from it, will you ask but your ſouls this one queſtion! <hi>what, can you dwell with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire?</hi> if you can, you may go on in ſin; but if you cannot, why then ſtop here, and repent of ſin: O now ſay, <hi>if this be the effect of ſin, Lord pardon what is paſt, and O give me grace that I may ſin no more, as ſometimes I have done.</hi> Methinks if a temptation ſhould come again for ordinary entertainment, you ſhould fright it away with the remembrance of theſe powerful words, <hi>depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>

Then ſhall they anſwer; Oh Sir, do not you aggravate the torment by your condemnation; the weight of Chriſt's doom is already unſupportable, but will you adde more weight? Why remember, we are ſome of us (it may be) of your fleſh and blood; many a time you told us that you unfeignedly loved us; and that we were dearer to you then all worldly enjoyments; many a time you told us that you were willing to ſpend your ſelf for us, as the candle that burns it ſelf to give others light; you were pleaſed to beſtow your prayers, tears, ſighs, groans for our ſouls; your very Books and Writings were high expreſſions, and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monuments of your dear love to us; you weighed not your ſtrength and ſpirits in compariſon of our ſouls; and ſhall this fair comical ſcean end in a diſmal, doleful, bloody Tragedy? would you do or ſuffer any thing to ſave us, and will you now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us? Oh forbear!</p>
                  <p>Ah no, (ſaith the Miniſter) I cannot forbear; all is true that you ſay, I loved you dearly, and I was willing to ſpend, or to be ſpent for you; but this aggravates the more; ah my travail, pains, books, writings, words, fears, ſighs, groans are in one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume together, and this volume has been opened this day, and now is the queſtion put; what have you profited by all my words, prayers, tears, ſighs, and groans? is not all loſt? and are not your ſouls loſt? and now do you tell me of love? what, did <hi>I</hi> ever love you more then Chriſt loved you? were the drops of my tears to be compared with the ſhowers of his blood? were my pains for you equal with the pains of his Croſs? and hath he not condemned you to hell? and ſhall not <hi>I</hi> be like-minded to Jeſus Chriſt? Surely the Lord's will muſt be my will; he hath already judged you, and he will make me to judge you; ſo far am <hi>I</hi> from pitying you, that if he that formed you will ſhew you no mercy, if he that ſaves me, and all the Elect people of God, will not ſave you, can <hi>I</hi> pity you, or ſave you, or diſcent from Jeſus in his ſentence upon you? ſpeak no more of fleſh, and blood, of labours, of love, Chriſt's Sentence muſt ſtand, and as <hi>I</hi> am a member of Chriſt, and a Miniſter of Chriſt, <hi>I</hi> cannot but approve of it, and ſo judge you to hell.</p>
                  <p>Why then (ſay Reprobates) we will curſe thee, and blaſpheme Jeſus Chriſt in hell for ever; curſed be the time that ever we heard of Jeſus Chriſt, or that ever we knew thee, or thy Miniſtry; do not thy Sermons ſend us deeper into hell? had it not been eaſier for us at this day of judgment if we had lived in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel never was Preached? didſt not thou harden our hearts in ſuch and ſuch Sermons, when the Word came home? didſt not thou deny us the ſeals which might have been for confirmation of our ſouls ſalvation? didſt thou not eſtrange thy ſelf from us in reſpect of any inward, intimate, and familiar ſociety, which thou affordeſt to others? doth not the event plainly ſhew, that all thy tears, prayers, words, and works, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to us, were hypocriſie, flattery, deceit, diſſimulation? Oh curſed be the day that ever we lived under ſuch a Miniſtry, or that ever we heard of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Nay then (ſaith the Miniſter) it is time for us to part; ſuch were your invectives on earth, and now they are, and will be your language in Hell; but have <hi>I</hi> not anſwer'd theſe cavils many a time? have <hi>I</hi> not told you that the Word would harden ſome, and ſoften others, the fault being in your ſelves? have <hi>I</hi> not cleared it that the ſeals are not to be ſet upon blanks, and that confirmation could not be without a work of converſion to lead it? and were we not commanded in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to withdraw our ſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly? did not the wiſe man tell us? <hi>he that toucheth pitch ſhall be defiled therewith,</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. FOR Chriſt and his Saints going up into heaven, and ſo for the end of this world: no ſooner are the Reprobates gone to their place, but the Saints aſcend; now Chriſt ariſeth from his judgment-ſeat, and with all the glorious company of heaven, he marches towards the heaven of heavens. Oh what a comely march is this? what ſongs of triumph are here ſung and warbled? Chriſt leads the way, the Cherubims attend, the Seraphims wait on, Angels, Arch-angels, Principalities, Powers, Patriarches, Prophets, Prieſts, Evangeliſts, Martyrs, Profeſſors, and Confeſſors of God's Law and Goſpel fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, attend the Judge, and King of Glory; ſinging with melody, as never ear hath heard, ſhining with Majeſty as never eye hath ſeen, rejoycing without meaſure as never heart conceived. O bleſſed train of Souldiers! O goodly Troop of Captains! each one doth bear a palm of Victory in his hand, each one doth wear a Crown of Glory upon his head; the Church Militant is now Triumphant; with a final overthrow have they conquered Devils, Death, and Hell; and now muſt they enjoy God, Life, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſometimes I have with much wonder and admiration beheld ſome Regiments paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſtreets; but had I ſeen thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Armies when they returned Victors, and made their ſolemn Triumphs in the ſtreets of <hi>Rome,</hi> oh then how ſhould I have then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired? never was the like ſight to this of Chriſt and his Army in this World.

If to theſe Scriptures I ſhould add one reaſon, I would argue from the end of the Worlds Creation; was it not partly for the glory of God? and partly for the uſe of man? now for the glory of God, the manifeſtation of it is occaſioned by the manifeſtation of the world unto man; if man therefore ſhould be removed out of the world, and no creature in it be capable of ſuch a manifeſtation, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his glory? And for the uſe of man, that is either to ſupply his neceſſity in matter of dyet, phyſick, building, apparel; or for his inſtruction, direction, recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, comfort, delight; now when he ſhall attain that bleſſed eſtate of enjoying God,

                  <p>The Texts more eſpecially objected againſt this opinion, are two; the firſt is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.21.</note>

                     <hi>and unproveable in his ſight;</hi> to this end Chriſt dyed that he might waſh us and cleanſe us by his blood, and then that he might preſent us without ſpot unto his Father. We may imagine Chriſt as going to his Father with his bride in his hand, and ſaying thus, O my Father, here is my Church, my Spouſe, my Queen; here are the Saints concerning whom I covenanted with thee from Eternity, concerning whom I went down from heaven, and dyed on earth, and aſcending up I have interceded theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years; concerning whom I went down to Judge the World, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſentenced them to life eternal, I now bring them in my hand to give them the poſſeſſion of thy ſelf.

                     <hi>I was ſet up from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> (i.e.) I was appointed and deſigned to be a Mediatour from all Eternity. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he was a Mediatour virtually and inchoatively from the Fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> then did he undertake that great Negotiation of reconciling God to man, and man to God; and actually he was a Mediatour after his Incarnation; for then was he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh, then was he manifeſted to be what before he was, then did he act that part viſibly upon earth, which before he had acted ſecretly and inviſibly in heaven; then he entred upon the work of his active and paſſive obedience; then he diſcharged his Prophetical and Prieſtly office here on Earth, which having done, then he entred upon his Kingly Adminiſtration in Heaven. Now as to this work he was called by God (<hi>him hath God the Father ſealed;</hi>

In this caſe it is with Chriſt as with ſome General, whom the King ſends forth with Regal Authority to the War, who having ſubdued the Enemy, he returns in Triumph, and all being finiſhed he makes a ſurrender of his place; thus Chriſt having diſcharged all his offices impoſed on him, now the work is finiſhed, he leaves his function by delivering up his Commiſſions to his Father.<note place="margin">Rev. 21.23.</note> 
                     <hi>In Heaven there is no need of Sun or Moon,</hi> that is, as ſome interpret, there is no need of Preaching, or Propheſying; of the Word or Sacraments, <hi>for the Lamb is the light thereof,</hi> Chriſt is the only means of all the communication that the Elect there ſhall have; and as for his Regal Office,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.24.</note> the Apoſtle is expreſs, <hi>then ſhall he deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father.</hi> Only here is the queſtion, how is Chriſt ſaid to reſign his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to God the Father?<note place="margin">Luk. 1.33. Heb. 1.8.</note> for ſaith not the Scripture, that <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom ſhall have no end?</hi> and that Chriſt's Throne is for ever and ever? for anſwer, I ſee no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction but that Chriſt may both reſign his Kingdom, and yet reſerve it. See a like caſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18.</note> 
                     <hi>All Power,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>in heaven and earth is given to me of my Father:</hi> ſhall we ſay now that the Father himſelf was quite ſtript of it? no; but as the Kingdom which the Father gave the Son is nevertheleſs called the Father's Kingdom, or <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> ſo Chriſt ſhall return it, yet retain it alſo. Two things (we ſay) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Term of Reign, <hi>ſci.</hi> Dominion, and Execution; to wear the Crown, and to bear the Scepter: now Chriſt in the former ſenſe ſhall reign for ever, the honour of dominion and of wearing the Crown he ſhall never reſign up to his Father, for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Throne diſturbs not his, there are both their Thrones at once, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.11. but the functions of a King, to ſit in Judgment, to reward deſervers, to puniſh evil-doers, to reſcue the oppreſſed, to fight with the enemy, Chriſt in this ſenſe ſhall ceaſe to reign, and ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to his Father.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, Chriſt is ſaid to deliver up the Kingdom in three reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he ceaſeth to execute that Authority, which nevertheleſs he hath; as a Judge that goeth from the Bench is a Judge ſtill, although he giveth no judgment, but imployeth his time about other occaſions; ſo Chriſt is ſaid to reſign his place, not that his Authority is ſubject to Diminution, but in that he makes no ſhew; for when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are all put under, there is no need that any more blows ſhould proceed from his Kingly power.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="605" facs="tcp:94897:262"/>1. Becauſe the manner of his Kingdom after the judgment day ſhall be wholly changed; he ſhall not Reign in the ſame faſhion that he did before; there's no need in heaven of good Laws to keep men from ſtarting into wickedneſs; the orders of this life are changed into a new kind of Government, and in that reſpect he is ſaid to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe he ceaſeth to increaſe his Dominion. In this World Chriſt was ſtill gaining more ſouls to his Kingdom by the Preaching of his Word, and ſo he ſpread his dominion further, and further; but when the Lord ſhall have made up the number of his Servants to his mind, then he will end the World, and give up the Kingdom, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> he will ceaſe to enlarge his confines any more, he will be content with the number of his Subjects that he hath already. Here is the Second thing, Chriſt preſents all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to his Father, he gives up his Prieſtly, Prophetical, and regal offices at his firſt entrance into heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He preſents himſelf unto his Father; not only his offices but Chriſt himſelf is preſented, and ſubjected unto God. This I take it, is the meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>then ſhall the Son alſo be Subject unto him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.28.</note> 
                     <hi>that put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</hi> The words are myſtical, and therefore we had need to underſtand them ſoberly, and according to the Analogy of Faith. The <hi>Arrians</hi> hence inferr'd, that the Son was not equal with the Father, becauſe he that is ſubject muſt needs be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to him whoſe Subject he is. But the Anſwer is eaſie, Chriſt is conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as God, or as man, and Mediatour betwixt God and Man; Chriſt as God hath us Subject to him, and is Subject to none; but Chriſt as man and Mediatour is Subject to his Father together with us. Some would have it, that Chriſt is Subject to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of his myſtical body, the Church; and that this only ſhould be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle, <hi>then ſhall the Church be Subject to the Father;</hi> but I cannot aſſent to this Expoſition. 1. Becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks expreſly of Chriſt and of his Kingdom. 2. Becauſe though <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſometimes in Scripture read for the Church, or for the body of Chriſt, yet the <hi>Son</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>the Father,</hi> is never ſo read or underſtood. 3. Becauſe we read, that he that is to be Subject, muſt firſt, have all things Subject to himſelf. Now the Father doth not properly Subject or ſubdue all things to the Church of Chriſt, but only unto Chriſt, and therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Chriſt's ſubjection to the Father; In the ſame way as Chriſt delivers up the Kingdom to the Father, is Chriſt alſo to be ſubject to his Father; but Chriſt delivers up his Kingdom as man, and as mediatour betwixt God and man; in theſe reſpects Chriſt (as we have heard) muſt Reign no more, at that day his Mediatourſhip ſhall ceaſe, and by conſequence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Mediatourſhip, or in reſpect of his humanity, he ſhall that day be ſubject to his Father.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, is not, and was not Chriſt always ſubject to his Father as man, or as mediatour betwixt God and man? how then do we limit this ſubjection to that day? <hi>then</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall the Son be ſubject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, this ſubjection will be <hi>then,</hi> or at that day more clearly manifeſted then ever it was before; then he muſt ſurrender his Kingdom to his Father in the ſight of men and Angels; then he ſhall lay aſide all his Offices in the view of all; ſo that henceforth God ſhall not Reign by the humanity of Chriſt, but by himſelf; nor ſhall we henceforth be ſubject to God through a mediatour Chriſt, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to God himſelf; nor ſhall Chriſt himſelf reign over us as mediatour any more, for the very glory of his Majeſty ſhall become ſo illuſtrious, that all eyes ſhall ſee how tranſcendently eminent the Deity of Chriſt is above all creatures, even above the humanity of Chriſt himſelf. That a fuller view of Chriſt's ſubjection ſhall be at that day then ever before: we may illuſtrate thus; by night the Sun Reigns or rules over us, but by the Moon; for the light of the Moon is borrowed from the Sun, though in the night we ſee not any ſubjection of the Moon to the Sun at all: but ſo ſoon as the Sun riſeth, preſently the Moon ſurceaſeth its office of lightning others, and becomes ſubject to the Sun it ſelf; not by a new ſubjection, but by a declaration of its former ſubjection, ſo that now all may ſee what eminency of glory and light the Sun hath both above the Stars, and above the Moon, thus it is with God and Chriſt, now it is God reigns over us, but only by Chriſt as Mediatour; God's immediate Reign we diſcern not ſo clearly for the preſent; but when the end ſhall come, and Chriſt ſhall ſurceaſe his Office of Mediatourſhip, then ſhall the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt's Divinity appear more eminently, not only above all creatures, but
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:94897:263"/> above the brightneſs of Chriſt's humanity it ſelf; and in this reſpect Chriſt then ſhall be Subject, if not by a new ſubjection, yet certainly by a new declaration and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his ſubjection, ſo as never was before.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.28.</note>9. FOR the end of Chriſt's Subjection to his Father <hi>that God may be all in all.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is the meaning: Chriſt therefore Subjects himſelf unto his Father, that God himſelf might be <hi>all in all;</hi> that God may no more Reign by a Deputy, or by a Chriſt, but that immediately and perfectly he may reign by himſelf, ſo that every one may ſee him face to face. Here we enjoy God (as it were) by means as in the uſe of the Word, and Sacraments, and the like, but when that Kingdom (where theſe Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made uſe of) ſhall be delivered up, then ſhall God himſelf be <hi>all in all,</hi> without means, without defect, without end.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable that Chriſt in his mediatory Kingdom hath ſome ſuch things as bear an Analogy to the means and inſtruments of governing in the Kingdomes of men; As, 1. He hath his Militia and his Laws, with threatnings and promiſes, in the ordinances of his Word. 2. He hath his grants, and ſeals, with many privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to confirm his people in the Ordinances of his Sacraments. 3. He hath his Officers and Embaſſadours for the management of ſpiritual affairs in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Miniſtry; but the ceaſing of Chriſt's Kingdom is the ceaſing of all theſe; and he therefore ceaſeth his Kingdom that God may immediately ſucceed all theſe; without any means, or without any Mediatour at all, he himſelf may be inſtead of all; or <hi>all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In proſecution of this, I ſhall diſcuſs. 1. The meaning, what it is for <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>all in all.</hi> 2. The particulars, wherein more eſpecially is <hi>God all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the meaning; it is a periphraſis of our compleat enjoyment of God: that God may be <hi>all in all,</hi> is as much as to ſay, that we may enjoy God alone to all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, neither wanting nor willing any thing beſides himſelf; for a perſon to be <hi>all in all</hi> to me, it is to have an enjoyment of that perſon to all purpoſes, ſo that I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do; nor need I to enjoy any thing beſides himſelf; thus God is to the Saints in glory, he is their exceeding great reward; they need nothing elſe beſides himſelf, their very droughts of happineſs is taken in immediately from the fountain, and they have as much of the fountain as their ſouls in their wideſt capacity, can poſſibly hold.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="607" facs="tcp:94897:263"/>2. For the particulars, wherein more eſpecially is <hi>God our all in all?</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In our enjoying God immediately; here we enjoy God by means; either he communicates himſelf unto us through his Creatures, or through his Ordinances, and hence it is, that we know him but in part, we ſee him but in a glaſs darkly;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12. 1 John 3.2.</note> but when he ſhall be our <hi>all in all,</hi> we ſhall ſee him face to face; we ſhall then ſee God as he is clearly and immediately. Oh how excellent is this enjoyment above all preſent enjoyments here below? as the enjoyment of a friend in his picture, letters, tokens, is ſhort of what we enjoy when we have his perſonal preſence; or as the heat and light of the Sun through a cloud is beneath that heat and light when the glorious body of it is open to us without any interpoſition; even ſo all the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God in the uſe of means, graces, bleſſings, ordinances are infinitely inferior to that enjoyment of God which ſhall be without all means; all the raviſhments of our ſpirit in prayer, hearing, reading, meditating, is but a ſip of thoſe Rivers which we ſhall have in heaven. I know the remembrance of God in a private meditation is ſweet, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 104.34. and communion with God in any Ordinance is <hi>a feaſt of ſweetneſs and marrow, and fatneſs.</hi> Pſal. 63.5, 6. But when the ſoul ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately poſſeſs God, when this Kingdom of grace ſhall expire, and all the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of it ſhall vaniſh away, will not the fountain be much more ſweet then all the ſtreams? ſurely <hi>feaſts, and ſweetneſs, and marrow, and fatneſs,</hi> are terms exceedingly too diminitive to give us any more than a ſmall hint of that incomprehenſible ſatisfaction by immediate communion. O the wonders of Heaven! there ſhall be Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a candle, and a perpetual day without a Sun, there ſhall be health without phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and ſtrength of Body without uſe of food; there ſhall be knowledge without Scriptures, and ſetled government without a written Law; there ſhall be Comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Sacraments, and Joy without promiſes to be its fewel; the ſoul in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall go ſtreight unto God, and immediately perticipate his glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. 'Tis the compariſon of a Learned Divine, <hi>ſuppoſe you ſaw a company of Chryſtal Globes placed in a parallel line, becauſe their poſture will not admit the Suns immediate beams; we'll ſuppoſe another ſingle Globe ſet by the middle of them, to tranſmit the Sun-beams unto all thoſe Globes, by this means they all ſhine, though it be only by reflection; but when the Sun ſhall ſo come about, as that they may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately receive its beams, there's no further uſe of the ſingle Globe then; ſo here, while we through our diſtance from God are uncapable of immediate enjoyment, there's a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Chriſt's Mediation, but when all things that cauſe the diſtance are removed, and we brought into the preſence-chamber of</hi> God <hi>himſelf, ther's no ſuch need of a Mediator then.</hi> Now here is one thing, wherein he is our <hi>all in all,</hi> ſhall enjoy him immediately.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It conſiſts in our enjoying of God fully. <hi>Now I know in part</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>but then I ſhall know, even as I am known;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12.</note> our enjoyment of God is but here in its infancy, there it will be in its full age; here it is in drops, there it will be in the Ocean, here we ſee God's back parts, and we can ſee no more, but there we ſhall ſee his face, not his ſecond face (as ſome diſtinguiſh) which is his grace and favour enjoyed by Faith, but his firſt face, which is his Divine eſſence enjoyed by ſight. Yet I mean not ſo, as if the ſoul which is a creature could take in the whole Eſſence of God which is incomprehencible; but the ſoul ſhall, and muſt be ſo full of God, as that it ſhall not be able to receive, or deſire one jot more. And oh how excellent is this enjoyment above all preſent enjoyments? it is now our higheſt happineſs to have ſome glimpſes of his glory ſhining on us, and ſome drops of his favour diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into us, oh but when God ſhall be our <hi>all in all,</hi> we ſhall have as much of God as our ſouls can hold, we ſhall have the glory of God ſo poured in, till we ſhall be able to receive no more. And here is that which gives the ſoul a full ſatisfaction; never would it be ſatisfied till it came to this; ſuppoſe that God would draw out all the beauty, ſweetneſs, goodneſs that he hath communicated to all Creatures in the world, and bring the quinteſſence of all, and communicate that unto the ſoul of one poor Saint, certainly it would not ſerve the turn, there muſt be a greater comunication before the ſoul be fully ſatisfied and reſt content; only once admit it into the glorious preſence of him who is <hi>all in all,</hi> and preſently it expires its infinite deſire into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of that God; for there's enough to fill his ſpirit, he cannot deſire ſo much, but there is more and yet infinitely more; if there be enough in God for the ſprrits of all juſt men made perfect with God, if there be enough in God for Angels whoſe
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:94897:264"/> capacities are greater than the Saints, if there be enough in God for Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe capacity is yet far wider than the Angels, if there be enough in God for God himſelf, whoſe capacity is infinitely greater than them all; then there muſt needs be ſatisfaction enough in God to any one poor ſoul. Here is another thing wherein God is our <hi>all in all,</hi> we ſhall enjoy him fully.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It conſiſts in our enjoying God ſolely. Not as if there were nothing elſe in Heaven but onely God; but that God in Heaven ſhall be <hi>all in all,</hi> and inſtead of all; it is God in Heaven that makes Heaven to be Heaven; the Saints bleſſedneſs, and Gods own bleſſedneſs doth conſiſt in the enjoyment of God himſelf; the Schoole-men tells us, that we ſhall not properly enjoy any thing elſe but only God; we may have ſome uſe of the Creatures, but no fruition; and therefore is God ſaid to be <hi>all,</hi> or as good as all. And indeed what can we imagine to be in Heaven, which is not eminently in God himſelf: if it be greatneſs, power, and glory, and victory, and majeſty, all theſe are his; if it be joy, or love, or peace, or beauty, or any thing amiable or deſirable, all theſe are in him. Hence ſome take it to be <hi>David's</hi> meaning, when he ſaid, <hi>he had none in Heaven but God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 73.25.</note> that the ſole enjoyment of God, (of God, and of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but God) is the ſouls true happineſs, when it is at higheſt; <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> whom? why there are Angels, there are Saints, there are the ſpirits of juſt and perfect men; are theſe nothing with <hi>David?</hi> O yes! all theſe are good, but they are not able to ſatisfie a ſoul without God himſelf. Whether God will make uſe of any Creatures for our ſervice then? or if any, of what Creatures? and what uſe? is more than I yet know; but to make up a full enjoyment there is required a gracious-glorious preſence, a ſweet effuſion or communication of that preſence, a juſt comprehenſion of the excellency of that communication, a perfect love, and a perfect reſt in the love of whatſoever it is we comprehend; now this is proper only to God; it is he only that fills the whole capacity of the Soul, it is he that ſo fills it that it can hold no more, it is he only that is the object of love intended to the utmoſt, and therefore he only is properly enjoyed, he only is poſſeſſed with a full contentment as portion enough, and as reward enough for the ſoul for ever.</p>
                  <p>But ſhall not the Saints have to do with ſomething elſe in Heaven, but only with God? O yes! I believe there ſhall be in Heaven a communion of the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in God, an aſſociation of the Saints and Angels of God: yet this ſhall not take away the ſole enjoyment of God, that he ſhould not be their all in all. For they ſhall not mind themſelves or their own good as created things, but altogether God; they ſhall not love them or one another as for themſelves, but only for God; here we love God for himſelf, and it is a gracious love; but there we ſhall love our ſelves for God, and 'tis a glorious love; why this is to enjoy God ſolely, in this reſpect he is <hi>all, and in all; whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a point enough to wean us to the World. Alas! the time is coming on a pace,<note place="margin">

Chriſtians! if you feel any inclinations, pantings, breathings after this world, give me leave to tell
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:94897:264"/> you, that you will never be happy till you have loſt all, till you have no friends, nor eſtates, no enjoyment but God alone; when all his done, when this world is nothing, when means ſhall ceaſe, both for bodies and ſouls, and when Chriſt ſhall ceaſe his Mediators office, and the Son of man be Subject to his Father, then God ſhall be <hi>all in all.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. It is not the Father perſonally and only, but the Deity eſſentially and wholly that is our <hi>all in all,</hi> when we ſay God is <hi>all in all,</hi> we do not exclude the Son, and holy Ghoſt, for the whole God-head is <hi>all in all</hi> to all the Saints, as well as the firſt perſon in the Trinity; the Father is <hi>all,</hi> and the Son is <hi>all,</hi> and the holy Ghoſt is <hi>all;</hi> and in that Chriſt is God, and the Son of God, we may ſay of Chriſt, that he is <hi>all in all</hi> only the truth of this poſition is not from the humane nature but from the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not derogatory to Chriſt, but rather it doth exceedingly advance Chriſt in the thoughts of all his Saints; while it was neceſſary Chriſt veyled his Deity, and when his work of Mediation is fully finiſhed, Chriſt then ſhall reveal his Deity to his Saints more then ever before. In this reſpect might I ſay if any perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity receives more honour than other, Chriſt ſhould have moſt;<note place="margin">Rev. 5.13.</note> 
                     <hi>every Creature which is in heaven heard, I ſay, bleſſing, honour, glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever;</hi> not only unto God, but particularly <hi>to the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> It is true, that God only, and God fully, and God immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is <hi>all in all,</hi> but doth that hinder that Jeſus Chriſt is not alſo only, fully, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>all in all?</hi> ſee how the Scripture joyns them together,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.22, 23.</note> which plainly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that they may conſiſt, <hi>I ſaw no Temple in the City, for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it, and the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it, for the glory of God does lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then as I have ſpoken of God, ſo that I may ſpeak of Chriſt, and conclude all with Chriſt, I aſſert this Doctrine, <hi>that the glory of Christ which the Saints ſhall behold in Chriſt to all eternity is their all in all.</hi> In the diſcuſſion of which I ſhall open theſe particulars. 1. What is the glory of Chriſt? 2. How the Saints ſhall behold his glory. 3. Wherein is the comprehenſiveneſs of this expreſſion, that the beholding of Chriſt is our <hi>all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is the glory of Chriſt? I anſwer, that the glory of Chriſt is either humane, or divine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is an humane glory, which in time was more eſpecially conferred upon his manhood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an eſſential or divine glory, which before time and after time, even from everlaſting to everlaſting iſſueth from the God-head; I ſhall ſpeak to both theſe, that we may rather take a view of Chriſt in thoſe glories (as we are able) wherein he will appear to his Saints as their <hi>all in all</hi> to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For his humane glory, that is either in regard of his Soul, or body; for his Soul, Chriſt was from the firſt inſtant of his conception full of glory, becauſe even then he received grace, not by meaſure, as we do, but as comprehenſion, he had the clear viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, even as the Angels of heaven, which aroſe from that hypoſtatical union of two natures at his firſt conception. It is true, that by the ſpecial diſpenſation of God, the fullneſs of thy accompanying that glory was with-held from Chriſt in the time of his paſſion, and the redundancy of glory from his ſoul unto his body was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deferred until the exaltation of Chriſt; but Chriſt no ſooner exalted, and ſet on the right hand of God, but immediately the interruption of joy in his ſoul, and the interception of glory from his ſoul to his body, was altogether removed. Then it was that his ſoul was filled with all joy, ſolace, pleaſure, which could poſſibly flow from the ſight of an object ſo infinitely pleaſing, as is the eſſence, Majeſty, and glory of God
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:94897:265"/> And then it was that his body was repleniſhed with as much glory as was propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable unto the moſt vaſt capacity of any creature; not only his ſoul, but his body is a glorious Creature; it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a body of glory,</hi> that is a moſt glorious body in it ſelf. And the ſpring of glory unto others, <hi>ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24.26.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſo to enter into his glory?</hi> it is called <hi>his glory,</hi> as if it were appropriated unto him as the moſt eminent ſubject, and principal efficient of glory; as if he had the monopoly of glory: all the glory in heaven is in ſome ſort <hi>his glory.</hi> Surely Chriſt's manhood is exalted unto an higher degree of glory than the moſt glorious Saint or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ever was, or ſhall be; principalities, powers, mights, and dominions fall ſhort of his glory.</p>
                  <p>But ſome object, that the mediatory office of Chriſt ſhall wholly ceaſe, and that the body and ſoul of Chriſt ſhall then be annihilated.</p>
                  <p>Indeed this was the opinion of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> that the human nature of Chriſt ſhould be changed or converted into the divine; and thus he interprets that Scripture, <hi>then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject, that God may be all in all,</hi> what is this <hi>ſubjection,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but a converſion of the Creature into the very ſubſtance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.28.</note> 
                     <hi>or eſſence of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour himſelf?</hi>

                     </note> But we deny the interpretation; the Son as man ſhall be ſubject, and yet the manhood of Chriſt ſhall ſtill remain: it is true that his Mediatory office ſhall wholly ceaſe, but it follows not that therefore the manhood of Chriſt ſhall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or changed into the Deity; there may be other reaſons for the continuation of his human nature beſides the execution of his Mediatory office; As, 1. That the luſtre of his Deity might ſhine through his humanity, and that thereby our very bodily eyes may come to ſee God, as much as is poſſible for any creature to ſee him, <hi>I ſhall ſee him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) not with other, but with theſe ſame eyes;</hi> 2. That the Saints may ſee how the power of an infinite God can conveigh the luſtre of his Deity into a Creature; upon this account I verily believe, that Angels and Men will be continually viewing of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he ſhall come to be admired of the Saints;</hi> he ſhall be admired (as we have heard) at the Judgment-day; nor is that all, but the Saints in heaven ſhall ſee with their eyes ſuch excellencies in Chriſt, as that they ſhall admire for ever; I ſay for ever, as much as they did at the firſt moment when they ſaw him; here if we ſee any thing excellent, we admire at firſt, but after a while we do not ſo, but in heaven there will be ſo much excellency in Chriſt, that we ſhall admire as much to all Eternity, as we did at the very firſt moment; there will be no abatement in glory of our being taken with the ſight of the glory in Jeſus Chriſt. 3. That Chriſt by his humanity may converſe more freely, and familiarly with his brethren in his Fathers houſe; oh the intimacy that will be there betwixt Jeſus Chriſt and his Chriſtian Saints! oh the mutual rejoycing and delight that will be there betwixt Jeſus Chriſt and his deareſt darlings! as Chriſt from Eternity rejoyced in the habitable part of his Earth, ſo will the Saints (his habitable Earth) to all eternity rejoyce in Chriſt; the eye of the Saints in glory can never be off Chriſt as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and God; now the eye of the Saints in glory ſhall never be off Chriſt as God and Mediatour then. Thus far of his human glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For his Eſſential divine glory, it is that glory which Chriſt hath as God: this he never laid aſide, but as the Sun in a dark gloomy day may not ſend forth its beams, ſo Chriſt the Son of righteouſneſs in the time of his abode upon earth (except a little glimps only in his transfiguration) did not ſend forth his glorious beams; but hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the body or humanity of Chriſt ſhall not hinder the breaking forth of all his divine glory. No ſooner the Son ſubject, and his Mediatory office diſcharged, but Chriſt, as God will manifeſtly put forth his more immediate glory to all his Saints. <hi>Behold, now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear, what we ſhall be, but we know when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 3.2.</note> 
                     <hi>for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Mark it, <hi>when he ſhall appear,</hi> at, and after the Reſurrection day, <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> (i.e.) we ſhall ſee the very eſſential glory of Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> But what is the eſſential glory of Chriſt?

I ſhall ſay no more therefore, let us be content to be ignorant of theſe things, till we enter into the confines of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>But whether ſhall this glorious Eſſence, or Eſſential glory of Chriſt be more ſeen, or manifeſted, at, or after the day of judgment, then ever it was before?<note place="margin">Queſt:</note> I anſwer. —</p>

This ſight is ſo great, that if a ſoul ſhould come from heaven to declare it, neither could that ſoul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, nor we underſtand it; we read of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whoſe ſoul Chriſt returned into his body, whom much people of the <hi>Jews</hi> came purpoſely to ſee, that they might hear ſtories of the other World, but not a word from him of any ſuch matter; <hi>Paul</hi>'s rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may ſatisfie with the reaſon of it, he heard there <gap reason="foreign">

The third period is at the Reſurrection, and during the time of the laſt Judgment, and then we ſhall ſee more of his glory; <hi>Camero</hi> affirms that <hi>'tis no curioſity to ſay, that the Saints and Angels in heaven</hi> had a new glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the exhibition of Chriſt, the great myſtery of <hi>the Incarnation being thereby bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known;</hi> and we may as ſafely affirm, that the Saints ſhall have a new glory, by new viſions of the glory of Chriſt at the day of Reſurrection; they ſhall then ſee the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of heavens glory carried on by Chriſt in his glorious actings; and all that ever the ſoul ſaw before in being with Chriſt in Heaven till the Reſurrection, ſhall be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up with the ſight of this glory of Chriſt at the Reſurrection-day. The laſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod is after the Reſurrection, and that ſhall continue even to all Eternity; now all the manifeſtations of Chriſt's glory before this, are but as a few green ears rubb'd in our hands, ſo that the full crop or the full harveſt is yet behind.

The eye in heaven ſhall be glorified; now glorification adds a ſingular excellency to the faculties, it advanceth the faculties, and raiſeth them to an higher pitch of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; glorification adds a greater capacity to the eye then ever it had before. In this world there is a difference in our eyes and ſight; a man of a clear ſight ſees more things, and more of every thing then a dark ſight doth; ſo a glorified eye ſees more of things then our eyes now can ſee; it ſhall be enlarged exceedingly to take in objects which now it cannot receive; glorification adds ſtrength to the faculties both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and external, ſo that the eye ſhall be able to look on the glory of Chriſt, not with difficulty, but with contentment; in this World every ſenſe we have is apt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by excellent Objects, and the more excellent, and tranſcendent the object is, the more it hurts and deſtroys the ſenſe; as the Sun by its brightneſs darkens the eye, and other things by mighty ſounds bring deafneſs to the ear; <hi>Paul</hi> indeed had a viſion of glory, but becauſe his faculties were not glorified, he was he knew not how, <hi>whether
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:94897:266"/> in the body or out of the body,</hi> whether alive or dead, he did not know; certainly the ſight of the glory of the other world would amaze, diſtract, and deſtroy us, if we had a ſight of it as now we are; but in heaven the eye ſhall have great pleaſure in beholding the brighteſt light, becauſe it ſhall be advanced to the higheſt pitch of ſtrength that may be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the eye ſhall be glorified, ſo it ſhall act in a glorified body, and this will make the ſight of the glory of Chriſt in ſtead of hurting us, to leave upon us, a more ſweet, enlivening, and powerful impreſſion. By this means all the impediments that hinder the conveyance of divine influences from that heavenly object will be removed. To il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this, let the moſt excellent ſight be ſet before a man that is defective in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſtate, and it doth not take him; what ſhould a ſick man do with ſuch things? he makes nothing of the moſt pleaſant gardens, orchards, buildings, nor of the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſights that are; when he is ſick, they are but ſick things to him, and of none effect; but in heaven the body ſhall be glorified, and ſtript of all corruptions and imperfections, ſo that there ſhall be no bar unto the influences of the glory of Chriſt which ſhall there be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As there ſhall be a glorified eye acting in a glorified body, ſo it ſhall be acted by a glorified Spirit; the eye is but the organ or inſtrument of ſight, and without the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would conveigh no more then a glaſs doth; it is the Spirit of a man that gives life to viſion, it is the Spirit of a man that diſcovers things, and ſets them forth in their worth, vertues, ends; now in heaven the ſpirit of men ſhall be glorified, and enabled to perform all thoſe offices in perfection; ſo that when a man ſhall look on the man Chriſt Jeſus by vertue of a glorified ſpirit, he ſhall ſee more, know more, taſte more than any other can; As a man of underſtanding when he looks on a diamond, or a wedge of gold he hath other apprehenſions of it, and a further touch upon his ſpirit, then a beaſt or a child in a cradle hath; ſo where the ſight of the eye is acted by a glorified mind, it takes in more from the ſight of every thing which is to be ſeen (unexpreſſibly more) then what can be done here by the moſt ſanctified Spirit in the World. Now in theſe reſpects Chriſt's glorified body (though it be the brighteſt viſible thing in the Heaven of Heavens) yet may it be the object of the eye of Saints, for they ſhall have glorified eyes, in glorified bodies, and acted by their glorified ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a mental viſion, a ſight of Chriſt by the eyes of our underſtandings; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this exceeds the former, the eye of the body is only on the body of Chriſt, but the eye of the ſoul is on the body and ſoul, on the Humanity and Deity of Jeſus Chriſt. This is the very top of heaven, when Saints ſhall be illightned with a clear and glorious ſight of Chriſt as God; Divines uſually call it, <hi>Beatifical viſion.</hi>

                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>1. Some ſay, Chriſt as God, or the God-head of Chriſt ſhall be known by the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt; ſuch a luſtre of his Deity ſhall ſhine through his humanity, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and by no other means ſhall the Eſſential glory of Chriſt appear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others ſay, That beſides the Humanity of Chriſt there ſhall be a ſpecies repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine Eſſence of Chriſt, and a light of glory elevating the underſtanding by a Supernatural ſtrength; and that thereby the glorious Eſſence of Chriſt ſhall be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others ſay, That the Divine Eſſence ſhall be repreſented to the glorified under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not by Chriſts humanity, nor by any ſpecies, but immediately by it ſelf, yet they alſo require a light of glory to elevate and fortifie the underſtanding by reaſon of its weakneſs, and infinite diſproportion and diſtance from the incomprehenſible Deity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Others hold, that to the clear viſion of Chriſt as God, there is not required a ſight of Chriſt's humanity as the firſt ſuppoſe; nor a ſpecies repreſenting the Divine Eſſence, as the ſecond ſuppoſe; nor any created light elevating the underſtanding, as the third ſuppoſe; but only a change of the natural order of knowing; It is ſufficient (ſay they) that the Divine Eſſence be immediately repreſented to a created underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; which though it cannot be done according to the order of nature, as experience tells us, (for ſo we conceive things as firſt having paſſed the ſenſe and imagination) yet it may be done according to the order of Divine grace.

<pb n="613" facs="tcp:94897:266"/> and Trinity in Unity; they ſhall ſee how the Son is begotten of the Father, and how the holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father, and the Son; they ſhall ſee the difference between the generation of the Son, and proceſſion of the Spirit. Theſe are myſteries in which we are blind and know very little or nothing, but in ſeeing his face we ſhall ſee all theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſhall ſee Chriſt at their firſt being, or principle of all the good that is in the World; <hi>they ſhall ſee how all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made;</hi> they ſhall ſee all the good in the creature as flowing from Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 1.3.</note> and as contained in the abſolute perfection of Chriſt's Divine Nature; they ſhall ſee in one Chriſt all the excellencies of all the creatures united, which is indeed to ſee him in his eminency if there be any beauty, riches, honour, goodneſs in any creature, that is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, tranſcendently, and originally in Chriſt, and that ſhall be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ſhall ſee Chriſt in all his ways, counſels, decrees, executions, tranſactions, from everlaſting to everlaſting; that great buſineſs of Election and Reprobation will then be diſcovered; it is an expreſſion of <hi>Auguſtine, They ſhall then ſee the reaſon why one is Elected, and another Reprobated; why one is rich, and another poor;</hi> they ſhall then ſee all the works that ever God did, or that ever God will do; it is not yet Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſince the creation of the World, and what is Six thouſand years to Eternity? certainly the truth of <hi>Origen</hi>'s opinion <hi>touching the exiſtency of other worlds before this,</hi>

                     <hi>and the future ſucceſſion of other Worlds after this,</hi> will then be known. If no worlds, before this, yet if God in Chriſt hath done ſuch great things in only Six thouſand years what he may do in the next Six thouſand years, and ſo in the next Six thouſand years, who now can tell? we ſee not theſe things, but the Saints in ſeeing the face of Chriſt ſhall ſee all things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They ſhall ſee Chriſt in all his glory, ways, counſels, decrees, executions, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, as working for their happineſs. Now this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> more then the former; there's a great deal of difference in ſeeing an object as excellent in it ſelf, and in ſeeing an object as conducing to my happineſs; As one that is a ſtranger, and another is an heir rides over ſuch a demeſgne; the ſtranger rides over it, and takes delight to ſee the ſituation, rivers, trees, and fruits, but the heir looks upon it after another manner, <hi>this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the land for which my Father laid out ſo much, and all to enrich me, and all to beſtow it on me, as my Inheritance.</hi> So the Saints admitted into the glorious ſight of Chriſt, they take not only a view of Chriſt, of the Eſſential glory of Chriſt, of the tranſactions of Chriſt, things excellent in themſelves, but they ſee all theſe as to make them happy; they ſay of Chriſt, and of all his actings, <hi>theſe are mine, and for my happineſs;</hi> A ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may look upon a King, and ſee beauty and Majeſty, and glory, and honour in him, but the Queen looks upon the King and his beauty as her own; ſo the Saints look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King of Heaven, they ſee Chriſt, and all in Chriſt as their own, to make them happy for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They ſhall <hi>ſee Chriſt as he is;</hi> but what? do we not <hi>ſee him now as he is?</hi> oh no:<note place="margin">1 John 3.2.</note> we now ſee him not as he is indeed and truth, but only as he is in hear-ſay, and report; we now ſee him only as he is ſhadowed out to us in the Goſpel of peace; and what is the Goſpel, but the pourtraiture of the King, which he ſent to another Land to be ſeen by his Bride? ſo Kings and Queens on earth wooe one another; whilſt the Bride is on earth, ſhe never ſeeth him as he is in his beſt Sabbath-Royal Robe of immediate glory, ſhe ſeeth him rather by the ſecond hand, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> by meſſengers, words, mediation; he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſends his pourtraiture, then comes himſelf; but in heaven the Saints <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> they ſee Chriſt himſelf in his own very perſon; they ſee the red and white in his own face; they ſee all the inſide of Chriſt; and thouſands of excellencies ſhall then be revealed, that we ſee not now; the myſteries of that glorious Ark ſhall then be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; his Incarnation, his two Natures in one perſon, his Suffering as Man, and his ſitting in the ſeat of God as God, all theſe ſhall be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They ſhall ſee Chriſt without interruption, and without intermiſſion to all Eternity. If once the eye be ſet on the face of Jeſus Chriſt, it will never be taken off again. Some conceive this to be the reaſon why the Saints in heaven can never fall away, becauſe they ſhall have a continual view of Chriſt as God; Surely to have but one glimpſe of Chriſt in this reſpect, though it were gone preſently, it were a great happineſs beyond all that the World affords; it was ſometimes the deſire of a Philoſopher to ſee the nature of the Sun, though he were to be burnt by it; ſo if Chriſt ſhould but grant us this happineſs, <hi>you ſhall come to ſee me, but the ſight of me will deſtroy you,</hi> this were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:94897:267"/> thing; but to have ſuch an excellent glorious ſight as ſhall never end; that Chriſt ſhould not only paſs by, but ſtand ſtill, ſo as the ſoul ſhall never loſe his ſight; O how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is this? if a man do but look upon a delightful Object, he is loath to have his eye drawn from it; ſurely the eye of Saints ſhall be eternally opened to ſee the divine nature of Chriſt; turn them which way they will, they ſhall never turn aſide the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied eyes of their underſtanding from off the Deity of Chriſt; he fills heaven; he is that fair Tree of life, the branches whereof in all that huge and capacious borders of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have not room to grow in; <hi>for the heaven of heavens cannot contain him.</hi> O the wonders of heaven. There is <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Elias,</hi> the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and the glorified Martyrs, but the Saints have neither leiſure, nor hearts to feed themſelves with beholding of creatures; no, no; all the eyes of heaven (which are a fair and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous company) are upon (only, only upon) the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the Father hath no leiſure to look over his ſhoulder to his Son; the Husband hath no leaſure to look over his ſhoulder to his Wife; Chriſt takes all eyes off from ſuch created things; ſurely 'tis enough for the Saints and Angels in heaven to ſtudy Chriſt for all Eternity; it ſhall be their only labour to read Chriſt, to ſmel Chriſt, to hear, ſee, and taſte Chriſt; to love, joy, and enjoy Jeſus Chriſt for ever and ever. Thus far of the ſecond point, how the Saints ſhall behold the glory of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wherein is the comprehenſiveneſs of this expreſſion, that <hi>the beholding of Chriſt is our all in all?</hi> I anſwer,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It comprehends the immediate ſeeing and looking upon all, that Majeſty and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which Jeſus Chriſt hath.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7.</note> In this ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> took it when he complained, <hi>we walk by faith, not by ſight.</hi> q. d. on earth we have faith, and in heaven we have ſight; it is ſome comfort that now I ſee Jeſus Chriſt by faith, but comparatively to that ſight which the Saints have in heaven it is as no comfort at all; alas! I am not, I cannot be ſatisfied ſo long as I am abſent from the Lord, I look upon my ſelf as one from home; And as a Prince in a ſtrange Land ſits down ſadly, becauſe he hath not the ſight of his Father, ſo I am forced to complain; <hi>O I cannot ſee my Lord, I would fain behold him, I am a ſtranger on earth, a Pilgrim in this world, I am not where I would be, I am abſent from him whom I moſt deſire; O I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt; I walk with him here on earth by faith, but to walk with him in the ſtreets of heaven by ſight is far better; O I long, I pant, I breath, I deſire, I think every day a year, and every year an age till I be in heaven, at home, in my Father's arms, that I may behold and ſee him, and that immediately, I ſay immediately in his glory.</hi> This is one way of beholding Chriſt, it is an immediate ſight.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It comprehends the fruition and enjoyment of Chriſt in his glory. Surely the Saints ſhall not be meer idle ſpectators of the glory of Chriſt, but they ſhall enjoy him, and be taken into fellowſhip with him: it was ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he did ſee the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but he was not admitted into it; it is otherwiſe with the Saints, they ſhall ſee heaven, and they ſhall enter into heaven, <hi>come thou faithful ſervant, and enter into thy Maſter's joy;</hi> not only behold it, but enter into it; they muſt behold Chriſt, and take poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and enjoy them as their own. And thus the word <hi>to ſee, or behold,</hi> is often uſed in Scripture; <hi>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> (i.e.) he cannot enjoy it:<note place="margin">John 3.3. John 17.24.</note> and <hi>Father I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory,</hi> (i.e.) that they may enjoy my glory; for Chriſt is not only glorious in himſelf, but he is the ſpring of glory unto others: now in this reſpect more eſpecially is Chriſt our <hi>all in all;</hi> he is <hi>all</hi> in himſelf, and if we enjoy him, he is <hi>all in all</hi> unto us: To ſee a little into the ſtate and condition of the Saints in glory in this enjoyment of Chriſt.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They poſſeſs Chriſt as their own; they go to Chriſt, and they lay hold on him, ſaying, <hi>thou art mine.</hi> It was indeed the language of the ſpouſe whilſt yet on earth, <hi>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine;</hi> there's a right, and a propriety made over to her in her betrothing unto Chriſt, but after the ſolemnity of the marriage is over, the poſſeſſion is then more full; when once the ſpouſe comes to behold Chriſt in his Kindgom, ſhe may then go boldly to her beloved, and ſay, <hi>all I ſee is my own; I had thee in hope, but now hope is vaniſhed, and actual enjoyment comes in place: lo, now I have thee in my eye, and in my heart, and in my hands, and in my arms; and as nothing ſhall ſeparate us now, for all our enemies are trod underfoot, ſo never will I part with thee, ſo far as to be out of my eye, I will ſtill behold thee, and in beholding I will ſtill poſſeſs thee, for thou art mine own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="615" facs="tcp:94897:267"/>2. They have the uſe of what they poſſeſs; and this is an infinite good to the Saints; they ſhall not only poſſeſs Chriſt, but they ſhall have what uſe they will of Chriſt, and of all in Chriſt; they ſhall as they pleaſe make uſe of his humanity, and of his Deity, of his glorious Eſſence, and of his glorious attributes; O wonder! that a Saint ſhould come to Chriſt and ſay, <hi>O my Lord, thou art mine, and my pleaſure is to make uſe of thy wiſdome, power, and mercy;</hi> and that Chriſt ſhould reply, and ſay, <hi>welcome ſweet ſoul, uſe me and all my glory as thou pleaſeſt,</hi> why thus it is; even as a friend will ſay to his friend, <hi>make uſe of all I have as your own;</hi> ſo will Chriſt come to his Saints, and bid them make uſe of all his riches, glory excellency, even as they will, even to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that they are capable of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have the ſweet and comfort of all they uſe; and this makes up a compleat enjoyment. In things below we may have the poſſeſſion of them, and the uſe thereof, but if we have not the ſweet and comfort of that we uſe, we cannot be ſaid truly or fully to enjoy thoſe things; what is the poſſeſſion and uſe of meat and drink, if we taſte not the ſweet of them? Hence God is ſaid to <hi>give us all things richly to enjoy;</hi> no creature can give us richly to enjoy another, one may give us ſuch and ſuch things wherein there may be comfort, but he cannot give us comfort in ſuch things, it is only God that can give us that; it is ſo with the Saints in glory, God gives them all things, yea, Chriſt gives himſelf to them as <hi>all in all,</hi> to enjoy him richly, fully, ſweetly, to the very uttermoſt. This another way of beholding Chriſt, it is a fruition or enjoyment of Chriſt, wherein and whereby he is our <hi>all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It comprehends all the effects and conſequents of ſuch a beholding of his glory, which are infinite delight and complacency in the will, and all praiſe and thankſgiving in the mouthes of his Saints. For the firſt, It is diſputed whether Eternal happineſs be more in the acts of the underſtanding, or if the Will? and ſome conclude that it is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the will, becauſe that is an active appetite, arid predominant in a man, indeed the whole of a man, oh the joy, delight, and complacency that will ariſe in the will upon the ſeeing and beholding of Jeſus Chriſt! they ſhall delight infinitely in the Eſſential glory of Chriſt, and in the declared glory of Chriſt; they ſhall delight in all that glory that is reflected upon Chriſt by all his creatures in heaven; they ſhall delight in his preſence, and in his love, <hi>Chriſt is all delights,</hi> and how then ſhould they but delight in Chriſt? for the ſecond, as they delight in their wills, ſo will their mouthes be filled with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; we read of Saints and Angels continually praiſing God in heaven; there ſhall be none of our duties of mourning, faſting, praiſing, humbling; the acts of patience and juſtifying faith ſhall ceaſe in heaven; but the duty of praiſing, and glorifying God will contiuue to all Eternity. Methinks I ſee the Saints following the Lamb; methinks I hear the familiar converſes betwixt Chriſt and them; as Chriſt opens himſelf to them, ſo they to him; firſt, he begins; <hi>Oh my deareſt Saints, you are they, for whom before all time I decreed this heaven, and now you ſee the execution of my decrees; whiles the world ſtood, I was ſtill carrying on the work of your ſalvation, either in doing or ſuffering, or in ſucceſſive works, applying my doings and ſufferings, my active and paſſive obedience to your perſons, and now the World is at an end, you ſee the end of my work, and the end of your faith, which is the Eternal Salvation of your ſouls; Oh how I have my wiſh, and you have your happineſs; here you and I will live together, that I may for ever behold you, and that you may for ever behold me, and my glory;</hi> which no ſooner ſaid, but methinks I hear all thoſe innumerable Saints in heaven to anſwer, <hi>worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 5.12.</note> 
                     <hi>to receive power, and riches, and wiſdome, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing, and therefore unto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings unto God and his Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Amen.</hi> Yea, methinks I hear every creature in heaven ſay, <hi>bleſſing, honour, glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> Why this is their continual work in heaven; they have nothing elſe to do, but with joy and gladneſs to ſing forth the praiſes of God, and of Chriſt, and that his mercy endureth for ever. And this likewiſe is comprehended under that notion of the Saints <hi>beholding of Chriſt,</hi> which compleatly makes up the propoſition aſſerted, <hi>that Chriſt, or the glory of Chriſt, which the Saints ſhall behold to all eternity, is their all in all.</hi>

                  <q>Thus far we have propounded the object which is <hi>Jeſus</hi> carrying on the Salvation of his Saints in his coming again to earth, and taking them up with himſelf and his Angels into heaven; our next work is to direct you how to <hi>look unto Jeſus</hi> in this reſpect, and then we have done.</q>

Many glorious excellent things, many precious paſſages, many high and heavenly carriages are in this tranſaction; Is it not of high concernment that he that now ſits at God's right hand interceding for us, ſhould thence come again to judge the World, and after judgment take up his Saints with him into glory? can we read of the ſeveral actings of this general Aſſize, and not deſire to read on ſtill? nay, is not all our reading mixt with admiration of every paſſage? come! wonder, and ſit, and pauſe, and ſtop, at every word; ſtay and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and adore that light, which appears in any beam of truth, and in the admiration of that truth which doth appear, caſt thy ſelf down at the feet of Chriſt, and cry out; <hi>O the depth of Glory, and Majeſty, and goodneſs, and grace in thee! O the riches of love that thou ſhouldſt let out thy ſelf in theſe ſeveral admirable diſpenſations!</hi> come be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in this ſtudy; gather up all the crumbs and fillings of this gold; the leaſt beams of the glory of Chriſt (eſpecially as it ſhines and glitters at his ſecond coming) have ſo much light, and love, and ſplendour in them, as that they will be very ſweet to look upon them: every piece or part of this knowledge will be of ſpecial uſe and worth, yea the low and imperfect knowledge of this myſtery is of infinite more value then the high and perfect knowledge of Ten thouſand things beſides. And one thing (O my ſoul) let me tell thee it is poſſible for thee to attain a very ſweet, and ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of this very knowledge. And therefore ſtudy cloſe, run over again all that hath been ſpoken, and dig yet deeper into that glorious mine; content not thy ſelf with a bare diſcovery of that gold-oare which is only upon the ſuperficies or top of the mine, but go ſo far as to find out the inward ſpiritual, and experimental knowledge, which the Saints by the light of the Spirit may come to attain. O ſtudy Chriſt in his ſecond coming to judgment.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. LET us <hi>conſider Jeſus,</hi> carrying on this work of Salvation at his ſecond coming. It is not enough to know, but we muſt meditate and ſeriouſly conſider of it A meer ſtudent may know Chriſt, and ſtudy Chriſt, as he knows and ſtudies other things: he may keep together many notions concerning Chriſt, and his coming to Judgment, but he hath no impreſſion of the holineſs of Chriſt upon his heart: and in this reſpect he is a ſtranger to Chriſt and all his actings; alas, he ſtudies Chriſt, but he doth not rightly, ſeriouſly, inwardly conſider of Chriſt, but he doth not <hi>look unto Jeſus,</hi> as one that looks to his pattern, or as one that looks to his refuge, hope, and help; true and ſpiritual conſideration, is a ſerious matter; its not ſome few and freeting thoughts that are the diſcharge of this work, but thoughts reſting, dwelling, fixing, and ſtaying upon Chriſt, until they come to ſome profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iſſue; O it is another manner of buſineſs then many are aware of; it's a thinking with thought upon thought; it's a reiteration and multiplication of the thoughts of the mind upon the Subject propounded; ſo the Scripture expreſſeth it, <hi>I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2.11, 12.</note> and in that next verſe, <hi>I turned to ſee;</hi> he <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon</hi> and <hi>conſidered</hi> his works, and he <hi>returned to behold</hi> them; he thought on them before, but now he returned to think; he renewed his thoughts upon the matter, and took a new view of them. Indeed when the underſtanding works ſeriouſly and ſpiritually, it will fetch things into ſight, and not only ſo, but it will hold them there, and faſten upon them,<note place="margin">Lam. 4.20.</note> and when they are gone, it will fetch them again, <hi>my ſoul hath them ſtill in remembrance,</hi> my ſoul in remembring doth remember them, and will not off till the end he obtained; ſo a man eyes Chriſt, till he have more of Chriſt, more of his
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:94897:268"/> preſence, and more of his light, and more of his favour, and more of his image. O let this be our work; let us thus conſider Jeſus in reference to his ſecond coming to judgment. And that we may do it in Order—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider Chriſt's preparing for judgment; realize it as if thou ſaweſt or heardſt the ſame; no ſooner the time determined which God hath appointed, but Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, make ready ye Angels to wait upon me, and make ready ye glorious ſouls that now are with me; it is the Fathers pleaſure, and it is my pleaſure to go down into the neather World, and to call before me all the men and women that ever lived in it; there will I paſs my doom upon all fleſh, and reward every one, good and bad, according to his works. O what a ſhout may I imagine in heaven at this news! what joy is in the ſouls of Saints that now they muſt go to their bodies, and enter into them, that both their ſouls and bodies, which ſometimes lived together, may now dwell together with Chriſt, in glory, and never part more? if thoſe that live on earth are commanded by Chriſt, <hi>To lift up their heads, becauſe their redemption draweth nigh;</hi> how much more ſhall they joy in Heaven, who alſo have <hi>waited for the adoption, to wit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note> 
                     <hi>the redemption of their bodies,</hi> that now the long-looked-for day is come, it is come, O the exaltation of the Angels at this tydings! This is worthy a pauſe, a <hi>Selah</hi> to be ſet upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider Chriſt's coming to judgment; all now in readineſs, the Son of God comes forth with all his glorious attendants;<note place="margin">Matt. 16.27.</note> 
                     <hi>For the Son of man ſhall come in the glory of his Father with his Angels,</hi> and with the ſouls of Saints, that for a time have been in Paradiſe. Oh what a goodly ſight is here! In this meditation I may ſee with <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 21.2.</note> 
                     <hi>The new Jeruſalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband.</hi> Down comes Chriſt, and down come the Angels, and down come the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect: and as they come along, ſee how they ſhake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and dim, and dark the very lights of Heaven; ſee what a flood of fire goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; ſee how they paſs into the cloud, where Chriſt makes a ſtand, and erects a Throne for himſelf to ſit on. Sure 'twill be a guilded glorious cloud, when Chriſt with all his celeſtial ſervants shall ſit upon it: a mornings cloud guilded with the beams of the Sun is admirably fair and shining; but what a shining cloud is that where the Sun of righteouſneſs with all his morning ſtars do ſit and shine? here's enough to dazzle my eyes, and to take up my thoughts; O my ſoul think on it!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider Chriſt's ſummons of the Elect to come under judgment; no ſooner in the cloud, but <hi>He ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24.31.</note> 
                     <hi>and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four winds, from the one end of heaven to another.</hi> Will not this be a ſtrange ſight to ſee Chriſt a coming, with Trumpets ſounding before him, cauſing all the dead to awaken out of their ſleeps of death; the very ſound of this Trumpet was ever in <hi>Jerom's</hi> ears, <hi>Ariſe ye dead and come to Judgment,</hi> and no queſtion but thy ears shall be filled with the blaſt thereof; the Trumpet shall found that shall bp heard over all the World; and then shall the dead ariſe out of their graves; and every Saints ſoul shall re-enter into his own body, by vertue of the reſurrection of Chriſt their Head. Can I paſs this meditation without ſome reflection on my ſelf? O my ſoul how joyfully wilt thou greet thy body, when thou shalt enliven it again? how wilt thou ſay, O my dear Siſter, whom I left behind me in the duſt when I went to Heaven? how ſweet is thy carcaſs, how comely is thy countenance? how do I enter into thee, and animate thee, and I will never more leave thee; thou waſt my yoke-fellow in the Lords Labours, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in perſecution and wrong; now shall we enter together into our Maſters joy? ſee, lift up thy head, behold Jeſus Chriſt yonder ſitting in the cloud; and lo here the Angels waiting on us, and coming to take us with the reſt of the Saints into the Air, to meet our Redeemer there. Could I but realize this ſummons, this reſurrection, this meeting of the ſoul and body, and going with the Angels into the judgment-ſeat, oh how would it work! and what work would it make within!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider Chriſt and the Saints meeting at the judgment day; oh how shall the Saints look, and ſtare, and gaze at the beauty of Jeſus Chriſt? oh how will they break out into admiration at the firſt view of thoſe glories which never before appeared on this ſide Heaven? is not this he <hi>(will they ſay)</hi> of whom we read ſo often, that he was fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the ſons of men? that he was white, and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thouſands; that his countenance was as <hi>Lebanon,</hi> excellent as the Cedars, glorious as when the Sun shineth in his ſtrength: but was ever the half told us of what now we ſee, and behold? O the ſuper-excellent, tranſcendent beauty of this Son of righteouſneſs! O the treaſures of lovelineſs in this Jeſus Chriſt never ſeen before! And thus as they admire, ſo they
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:94897:269"/> adore; now they begin thoſe Hallelujahs, that never, never ſhall have end; they fall at the feet of Chriſt, and the Lord Chriſt takes them up with his hands, and folds them in his arms; oh what mutual reciprocal ſalutations are theſe betwixt Chriſt and his members? oh my head! and oh my body! oh my husband! and oh my ſpouſe! oh my dear! and oh my darling! never two lovers met with ſuch heat of love, as Chriſt and his Saints; come, ſaith Chriſt, and ſit you down here at my right hand, and let the world be on my left hand; it was otherwiſe with you in your life-time, my gold and my jewels were then caſt in the duſt; you were then cloathed with infamy, and the vileſt of men were then guilded with honour; but now I will ſet all right, now the duſt shall be ſwept away, and the jewels of my Kingdom shall be gathered up; now the Goats ſhall be driven into the deſart, and you who are the Sheep ſhall be brought into my fold. Oh my ſoul, what a meeting is this? what a ſight will this be, to behold the Saints in this condition, and thy ſelf amongſt them? couldſt thou but realize this one very paſſage, it were enough to quench thy luſt, and to kindle a flame of pure love in thy heart to Jeſus Chriſt; it is a quickning, rouzing, riſing, rejoycing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider Chriſt ſentencing the Saints for eternal glory; then ſhall the books be opened, and all the good works of the Saints ſhall be revealed and made known; and then ſhall the Judg from his Throne of Majeſty (in the ſight and hearing of all the world) pronounce that ſentence, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherite the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 25.34.</note> q. d. Come my Saints, come with me into glory; come now from labour to reſt, from diſgrace to glory, from the jaws of death to the joys of eternal life; for my ſake ye have been railed on, reviled and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but now it ſhall appear to all thoſe curſed <hi>Eſaus,</hi> that you are the true <hi>Jacobs</hi> that ſhall receive the bleſſing, and bleſſed ſhall you be; come now and poſſeſs with me the inheritance of Heaven, where you ſhall be for love, Sons; for birth-right, heirs; for dignity, Kings; for holineſs, Prieſts: come, you may boldly enter in, for my Father hath prepared, and kept it for you, ever ſince the firſt foundation of the World was laid.</p>
                  <p>O my ſoul, doſt thou not remember when ſometimes thou haſt been at the feet of Chriſt in the beauty of holyneſs, and there tookeſt in thoſe droppings of his ſpirit; which were better to thee than the feaſts of Kings? doſt thou not remember when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thou haſt had the very beams of light darted from the face of Jeſus Chriſt, when he whiſpered to thy ſoul the forgiveneſs of thy ſins, ſaying, <hi>Fear not, thy ſins ſhall not hurt thee, I am thy ſalvation?</hi> oh what joy was then? what meltings, movings, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, leapings of heart were then in thy boſom? but was that joy any thing to this, or to be compared with this? that was a drop, but here's an Ocean, here's fulneſs of joy; oh what leapings of heart, what raviſhments will be within when thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelf in the arms of Chriſt, and ſhalt receive words of life from the mouth of Chriſt, in the face of all the World? what a thing will this be, when Chriſt ſhall paſs a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death on others, and ſpeak words of life unto thee? when thou ſhalt ſee him frowning upon the world (and oh thoſe frowns will break the heart) and shalt behold him ſmiling in the fulneſs of his love upon thy ſelf? that Chriſt at ſuch a time should be delighting-thee with all the imbraces of love, and with this ſweet invitation to Heaven, <hi>Come thou bleſſed inherite the Kingdom,</hi> it were enough to a ſpirit a ſoul half dead; the very meditation of this muſt needs be ſweet.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider Chriſt and the Saints Judging the reſt of the world; no ſooner are the Saints ſentenced, but Chriſt turns to the wicked, and bids them <hi>go into everlaſting fire;</hi> in which ſentence the Saints shall joyn with Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Do ye not know that the Saints ſhall judge the World?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.2.</note> when the Saints appear, it is not only by a Summons, but with commiſſion; not only to be judged, but to judge; not only shall they ſtand at Chriſts right hand, but they shall ſit down on the Throne of the Son of God, to judge the wicked Angels and the World. O the torment! O the vexation of wicked men and Devils, when they shall ſee thoſe very men whom they ſcorned, oppreſſed, perſecuted, to be now advanced, not onely to glory, but to be their judges! it is as if ſome Noble man had wronged ſome Poor man, and that the King should therefore deliver the Noble man into the power of the poor man,<note place="margin">Pſal. 112.10.</note> to take his own revenge: Surely, <hi>The ungodly ſhall ſee this, and be grieved, he ſhall gnaſh with his teeth for indignation, and melt away:</hi> but on the contrary,<note place="margin">Pſal. 58.10.</note> 
                     <hi>The righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth the vengeance, he ſhall waſh his foot-ſteps in the blood of the ungodly.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>O my ſoul, doſt thou believe this truth? and art thou confident that thou ſhalt ſit with Chriſt on his very Throne to judge the World? why then be joyfull in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exerciſe thou patience in the cenſures and judgments of the World, know thou for thy comfort that there is a turn and time of judging, and therefore ſay,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>With me it is a ſmall matter that I ſhould be judged of you, or of man's Judgment,</hi> as the original hath it, <hi>of man's day.</hi> Is it not enough to command patience, if <hi>God's day</hi> be at hand, when I shall judge my unjuſt judges; hark what the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.7, 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Be patient Brethren unto the coming of the Lord, behold the Husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, untill he receive the early and latter rain; be ye alſo patient, ſtabliſh your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh,—behold the judge ſtandeth before the door.</hi> Come exerciſe patience, let the World be judging; if they will needs ſlander, reproach, and perſecute thy ſoul, they had better abuſe any judge on earth than thee: though thou art the pooreſt, weakeſt, meaneſt of God's Saints upon the earth, they will know one day that they have abuſed their own judge in abuſing thee. And therefore be thou quiet, ſilent, patient; Say as <hi>David, let him alone, and let him curſe, yea, let him judge, for the Lord hath bidden him; it may be the Lord will look, on mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and will requite good for his Judging this day; this is his day; but the day of the Lord is my day, and then ſhall I ſit with Chriſt on his Throne to judge the World.</hi> Oh the ſweet that I may ſuck from this hony-comb, of Chriſt and his Saints judging the World!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider Chriſt and his Saints going up into Heaven. No ſooner hath he done his work with the World, and ſent them away, but then he shall conduct all his flock like a faithful shepherd to their fold; then shall he go with all his troops following him into Heaven. Hath not Chriſt ſaid ſo? <hi>If I go away, I will come again,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there you may be alſo.</hi> O thoſe ſongs of joy, and shouts of praiſe that will fill the World at that day! And thus as they go along, Heaven opens unto them, and they enter in; what welcomes they have there is paſt my telling; if we may imagine and gueſs, O the welcome that Chriſt will give! <hi>Come my ſpouſe, and come my dear, come all my Saints; here be thoſe Manſions that I went before to prepare and make ready for you, here be thoſe everlaſting habitations wherein you and I will dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; here is your Fathers houſe, the building of the wall is all of Jaſper,</hi>

                     <hi>and the worſt piece of it is all of pure Gold, like unto clear Glaſs; why this is your home, your houſe made without hands, here you and I will ſpend our time, eternity it ſelf, in joying, enjoying, and beholding of each other.</hi> And as thus Chriſt ſalutes them, ſo will the Angels, thoſe Created Citizens of Heaven ſalute them too; for if joy be in Heaven at the converſion of one ſinner, what joy will there be at the glorification of all theſe Saints? what welcome, entertainment, will the Angels give to theſe new gueſts at their firſt enterance into Heaven?</p>
                  <p>O my ſoul, if thou art one of them that shalt have this welcome, what wilt thou ſay when thou art admitted in thither! if weeping were in Heaven, wouldſt thou not weep for joy? ſure theſe things are no fictions of man's brain, but truths, and realities; and as they are true and real, ſo they are exceeding full of joy; all the excellencies of this World are but a dream in compariſon of them; even the Sun in its brightneſs is but darkneſs to this glory that shall then be ſeen. Come, think over theſe things, and be ſo enlarged in thy thoughts, that before they go, thou mayeſt feel the ſweet, and taſte of this goodneſs of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Conſider all the ſeveral tranſactions that will follow in Heaven: then will Chriſt preſent all his elect to God his Father; then will he give in all his commiſſions which he hath received from his Father; <hi>Then will the Son himſelf be ſubject to the Father, that God may be all in all.</hi> I cannot ſtay to enlarge on theſe; Onely remember, though <hi>God may be all in all,</hi> that excludes not Chriſt, for he alſo is <hi>All in all</hi> to all his Saints, even to all eternity; Immediate viſions and fruitions of Chriſt, as God is the very top of Heavens joy: <hi>Chriſt is all, and in all;</hi> Chriſt is the center of Heavens happineſs; Chriſt is the well-ſpring that fills the capacities of Saints and Angels; Chriſt is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of happineſs it ſelf, there is as much happineſs in Chriſt as happineſs is; what ever belongs to glory, is in Chriſt, <hi>In him dwels all the fulneſs:</hi> whatever excellency is in Heaven, it is in Chriſt, not onely in perfection, but connexion, for all thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies meet together, reſt in Chriſt; and Chriſt is all good things to all his Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he is Beauty to their Eyes, Muſick to their Ears, Honey to their mouths, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume to their Noſtrils, Health to their Bodyes, Joy to their Souls, Light to their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:94897:270"/> Content to their Wills; he is Time without ſliding, Society without loathing, Deſire without fainting, Alpha and Omega, the beginning and ending; wanting both, needing neither, yet the Author of them both, he is <hi>All in all,</hi> from one, not all. Even all the Strength, Wit, Pleaſure, Vertues, Colours, Beauties, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and goodneſs that are in Men, Beaſts, Fiſhes, Fouls, Trees, Herbs, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are nothing but ſparkles of thoſe things which are in Chriſt. Chriſt himſelf will then ſupply their uſe, ſo that the beſt Creatures which now ſerve the Saints, ſhall not have the honour to ſerve them then;<note place="margin">Rev. 21.23.</note> 
                     <hi>There will be no need of the Sun, nor of the Moon, to ſhine in that City, for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence the beholding of Chriſt is the <hi>All in all</hi> to his glorified Saints: this was Chriſt's Prayer, <hi>Father I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am,</hi> to what end?<note place="margin">John 17.24.</note> 
                     <hi>that they may behold my glory.</hi> Chriſt's heavenly preſence is conſpicuous, he is not preſent as ſome things that are not ſeen, and yet are preſent; but his preſence is, or certainly ſhall be conſpicuous to all his Saints: when he was in the world his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was covered under a mean outſide, he was like a bright light in a dark-Lanthern, and there were very few that knew him then; but in Heaven he ſhall be as a Cabinet opened, or as the Sun in his full glory; <hi>We ſhall know him as we are known, and behold him face to face,</hi>

                     <hi>and we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Nor only will he be conſpicuous, but his preſence ſhall be vital; a ſtone may be with us, and ſeen clearly, but there's little in the ſight of that; in the beholding of Chriſt there will be an acting of kindneſs upon the Saints, there will be viſions with life and dear refreſhing: O the influences that the ſight of Chriſt will have on his Saints in Heaven! nor onely will he be conſpicuous and vital, but his preſence ſhall be fixed; he ſhall abide with the Saints, that they may for ever behold him. Oh if there was ſuch running after Chriſt in this world, ſome getting on hills, and others on trees, that they might behold him, when he paſſed by, what will the ſight of Chriſt in Heaven be, when he ſhall be alwayes in the eye of his Saints, and never out of ſight, when they ſhall be alwayes viewing of him, and be alwayes ſatisfied with that view? nor only will he be conſpicuous, vital, fixed, but his very preſence ſhall transform; <hi>They ſhall ſee his face,—and they ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi> O the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this ſight!<note place="margin">Revel. 22.4, 5.</note> it is of ſuch a transforming Nature, that to ſee the King will make Kings; this viſion of glory amounts unto a fruition of glory, if ever thou art a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Chriſt, thou art ſure to be a partaker of Chriſt in all his glory. <hi>I ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>

                     <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> Of Loving Jeſus in that reſpect.</head>
                  <p n="6">6. LET us <hi>love Jeſus,</hi> as carrying on the great Work of our Salvation for us in his ſecond coming. In proſecution of this, I muſt firſt ſet down Chriſt's love to us, and then our love to Chriſt; that is the cauſe, and this effect; that is the ſpring, and this the ſtream; in vain ſhould we perſwade our hearts to love the Lord, if in the firſt place we were not ſenſible that our Lord loves us,<note place="margin">John 4.19.</note> 
                     <hi>We love him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> it is Chriſts way of winning hearts, he draws a lump of love out of his own heart, and caſts it into the ſinner's heart, and ſo he loves him. Come then let us firſt take a view of Chriſt's love to us, and ſee if from thence any ſparks of love will fall on our hearts to love him again. Should I make a Table of Chriſt's acts of love and free-grace to us, I might begin with that eternity of his love before the beginning, and never end till I draw it down to that eternity of his love without all ending: his love is as his mercy, from everlaſting to everlaſting; he loved us before time, in the beginning of time, in the fulneſs of time, at this time the flames of his love are as hot in his breſt as they were at firſt, and when time ſhall be no more he will love us ſtill; this fire of Heaven is everlaſting; there is in the breſt of Chriſt an eternal coal of burning love, that never, never ſhall be quenched. But I have in ſome meaſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcovered all thoſe acts of his grace and love, till his ſecond coming: and therefore I begin there.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt will come; is not this love? as his departure was a rich teſtimony of his love.<note place="margin">John 14.18.</note> 
                     <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away;</hi> ſo is his returning, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come unto you;</hi> Oh how can we think of Chriſt's returning, and not meditate on the greatneſs of his love? might he not ſend his Angels, but he muſt come himſelf? is it not ſtate and majeſty enough to have the Angels come for us, but that he himſelf muſt come with his Angels, to meet us more than half the way? what King on Earth would adopt a beggar, and after his adoption would himſelf go in perſon, to fetch him from the dunghil to his Throne? we are filthy lazars, from the crown of our heads to the ſoles of our feet we are full of ſores, and yet the King of Heaven puts on his beſt attire, and comes in perſon with all his retinue of glory, to fetch us from our graves, to his own Court of Heaven. Oh the loves of Chriſt in this one act, he will come again, he is but gon for a while, but he will come again in his own perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt will welcome all his Saints into his preſence; and is not this love? after he is come down from Heaven; he ſtays for them a while in the Clouds, and commanding his Angels to bring them thither, anon they come; and oh how his heart ſprings within him at their coming! what throbs and pangs of love are in his heart at the firſt view of them? as they draw near, and fall down at his feet, and worſhip him; ſo he draws near, and falls upon their necks, and welcomes them. Methinks I hear him ſay, <hi>Come bleſſed ſouls, you are my purchaſe, for whom I Covenanted with my Father from eternity; O you are dearly welcome to your Lord, in that now I have you in my arms; I feel the fruit of my death, the acceptation of my Sacrifice, the return of my prayers; for this I was born and dyed, for this I roſe again and aſcended into Heaven, for this I have interceded a Prieſt in Heaven theſe many years; and now I have the end and deſign of all my actings and ſufferings for you, how is my joy fulled?</hi> look as at the meeting of two lovers there is great joy, eſpecially if the diſtance hath been great, and the deſires of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another vehement; ſo is the meeting of Chriſt with his Saints; the joy is ſo great that it runs over, and wets the fair brows, and beauteous locks of Cherubims and Seraphims; and all the Angels have a part of this banquet at this day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt will ſentence his Saints for eternal life; here is love indeed, every word of the ſentence is full of love; it contains the reward of his Saints, a reward beyond their work, and beyond their wages, and beyond the promiſe, and beyond their thoughts, and beyond their underſtanding; it is a participation of the joyes of God, and of the inheritance of the Judge himſelf: <hi>Come enter into your Maſters joy, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Oh but if all the Saints have only one Kingdom, where is my room? fear not O my ſoul, thou ſhalt have room enough; though but one Kingdom, yet all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants there are Kings; whole Heaven is ſuch a Kingdom, as is intirely, and fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:94897:277"/> by one glorified Saint, all and every one hath the whole Kingdom at his own will; every one is filled with God, as if there were no fellows there to ſhare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt will take up all his Saints with him into glory; where he will preſent them to his Father; and then be their <hi>all in all</hi> to all eternity. This is the heig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of Chriſt's love; this is the immediate love that comes out from the precious heart and bowels of Jeſus Chriſt; this is that Zenith of love, when ſenſibly and feelingly it burns at hotteſt; it is true, that Chriſt's love breaks out in all thoſe precedaneous acts, we have already ſpoken; Oh but what loves will he caſt out from himſelf in glory? the more excellent the Soyl is, and the nearer the Sun is, the more of Summer, and the more of day; the more delicious muſt be the Apples, the Pomgranates, the Roſes, the Lillies that grow there; ſurely Chriſt in glory is a bleſſed ſoyl; Roſes, and Lillies, and Apples of love, that are eternally Summer-green and ſweet, grow out of him; the honey of Heaven is more than honey; the honey of love that is pure, and unmixt, and glorious in Chriſt, muſt needs be incomparable. I cannot ſay, but that Chriſt's love, like himſelf, is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever;</hi> there is no intenſion,<note place="margin">1 John 4.8.</note> or remiſſion of his love as in it ſelf; for <hi>God is love,</hi> he is eſſentially love; and therefore admits of no degrees; yet in reſpect of the ſenſe, or manifeſtation of this love of Chriſt, there muſt needs be a difference; thus if he loved his ſpouſe on earth, how much more will he love her when his Bride in Heaven? If he loves us while ſinners, and enemies to his holineſs, how much more will he love us, when we are ſons, and perfected Saints in glory; he that could ſpread his arms, and open his heart on the Croſs, will he not then open arms, and heart, and all to them that reign with him in his Kingdom? if in this life ſuch is loves puiſſance, that we uſually ſay of Chriſt, <hi>Though the head be in heaven, yet he hath left his heart on earth with ſinners;</hi> what ſhall we ſay of Chriſt in glory, where love like the Sun ever ſtands in the Zenith?<note place="margin">Deut. 33.27.</note> where <hi>the eternal God is the ſouls everlaſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. And if Chriſt love thus; how ſhould we love again for ſuch a love? Lord, what a ſum of love are we indebted to thee? is it poſſible that ever we ſhould pay the debt? can we love as high, as deep, as broad, as long as love it ſelf, or as Chriſt himſelf? no, no; all we can do is but to love a little; and Oh that in the conſideration of his love we could love a little in ſincerity! Oh that we were but able feelingly to ſay, <hi>Why Lord I love thee, I feel I love thee, even as I feel I love my friend, or as I feel I love my ſelf.</hi> Such arguments of love have been laid before us, as that now I know no more; we have ſeen whole Chriſt cap-a-pe; we have heard of the loves of Chriſt from eternity to eternity; we have had a view of the everlaſting Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein his love is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us as hot as death, or as the flames of God; and do we not yet love him? hath Chriſt all this while opened his breſt and heart to us, ſaying, <hi>Friends, Doves, come in, and dwell in the holes of this rock?</hi> And do we ſcratch his breſt? do we turn our backs upon him, and requite his love with hatred? ſurely this is more than ſin; for what is ſin but a tranſgreſſion of the law? but this ſin is both a tranſgreſſion of Law and Goſpel. What? to ſpurn againſt the warm bowels of love? to ſpit on grace? to diſdain him who is the white and ruddy, the faireſt of Heaven? Oh the aggravation of this ſin! 'its an heart of flint and adamant that ſpits at Evangelick love: Law-love, is love, but Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick love is more than love; its the gold, the flower of Chriſt's wheat, and of his fineſt love. Oh the many Goſpel-paſſages of love that we have heard! Oh the ſweet ſtreams of love that we have followed, till now that we are come to a Sea of love, to an heaven of love, to an infinite, eternal, everlaſting love in heaven! I want words to expreſs this love of Jeſus; a Sea of love is nothing, it hath a bottom; an Heaven of love is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it hath a brim; but infinite, eternal, everlaſting love hath no bottom, no brim, no bounds, and do we not yet love him? do we not yet feel the fire of love break forth? if not, it is time to turn our Preaching into Praying; <hi>O thou who art the Element or Sun of love, come with thy power, let out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. LET us <hi>joy in Jeſus,</hi> as carrying on the great work of our ſalvation for us in his ſecond coming. Chriſt delights to have his People look upon him with delight; for a ſoul to be always under a ſpirit of bondage, and ſo to look upon Chriſt as a Judge, a Lyon, or an offended God, it doth not pleaſe God; the Lord Jeſus is tender of the joy of his Saints, <hi>Rejoyce, and be exceeding glad,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>rejoyce evermore,—rejoyce in the Lord alwayes;</hi>

Let the righteous be glad, let them rejoyce before God, yea let them exceedingly rejoyce.</hi> All that Chriſt doth to his Saints tends to this joy, as the upſhot or end of all; if he caſt down, it is but to raiſe them up; if he humble, it is but to exalt; if he kill, it is but to make alive; in every diſpenſation ſtill he hath a tender care to preſerve their joy. This is the <hi>Benjamin,</hi> about which Chriſt's bowels beat; <hi>Let my Children ſuffer any thing, but nothing in their joy; I would have all that love my Name to be joyfall in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh, ſay ſome, but Chriſt's day is a terrible day; when Chriſt appears, he will make the Heavens, and Earth, and Hell to ſhake and tremble. <hi>Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence;</hi>

                     <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then we which are alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air,—wherefore comfort one another with theſe words.</hi> Chriſt's coming is a comfortable doctrine to all believers; and therefore all the Elect that hear theſe words, ſhould be comforted by them. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

Hence ſome call this the day of the believers full juſtification; they were before made juſt, and eſteemed juſt, but now by a lively ſentence they ſhall be pronounced juſt by Chriſt himſelf; now is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat acquittance, or the full abſolution from all ſin; now will Chriſt pardon, and ſpeak out his pardon once for all; now will he take his book (wherein all our ſins, as ſo many debts or treſpaſſes are written) and he will cancel all;<note place="margin">Acts 3.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Your ſins ſhall be blotted out</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> And is not this enough to cauſe our joy? when the ſpirit witneſſing with our ſpirits, doth but in part aſſure us of ſins pardon, is it not exceeding ſweet? Oh but how ſweet will be that ſentence, which will fully reſolve the queſtion, and leave no room of doubting any more for ever? conſider O my ſoul, the day is a coming, when the Judge of Heaven and Earth will acquit thee of all thy ſins before all the World; it is a part of his buſineſs at that day to glorifie his Juſtice and free grace in thy abſolution. O Chriſtians! how may we comfort one another with theſe words?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt in the iſſue will lead us into glory.

And is not this joy of our Lord enough to cauſe our Joy; Oh what embraces of love, what ſhaking of hands, what welcomes ſhall we have into this City? there ſhall we ſee Chriſt in his garden, there ſhall we be ſet as a ſeal on Chriſt's arme, and as a ſeal upon his heart; there ſhall we be filled with his love, enlightned with his light, encircled in his arms, following his ſteps, and praiſing his Name, and admiring his glory; there ſhall we joy indeed, <hi>For in thy preſence there is fulneſs of joy,</hi>

O the Songs of the high Temple, without either Temple or Ordinances, as we have them here! can we chooſe to joy at the thought of this joy above? if God would ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe, that even now we might ſtand at the utmoſt door of Heaven, and that God would ſtrike up a window, and give us a ſpiritual eye, and an heavenly heart, ſo that we could look in, and behold the Throne, and the Lamb, and the troops of glorified ones cloathed in white; would not this chear up our hearts, and fill them with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory? certainly this day will come, when Chriſt will bring us not only to the dore, but <hi>through the gates into the City;</hi> and then we ſhall ſee all theſe ſights, and hear all the muſick made in heaven: how then ſhould we but <hi>joy in the hope of the glory of God?</hi> O methinks raiſed thoughts of our manſion in glory, ſhould make us ſwim through the deepeſt Sea of troubles, and afflictions, and never fear. Come then, O my drowzy ſoul, and harken to theſe motives; if yet thou ſeeſt not the Son it ſelf appear, methinks the twilight of a promiſe ſhould revive thee; it is but a little while, <hi>And he that ſhall come, will come, and he will not tarry.</hi> It may be thou art reviled, and perſecuted here on Earth; and what then? hath not Chriſt bid thee to <hi>rejoyce in afflictions?</hi> is it not his word, that in this very caſe thou ſhouldſt <hi>rejoyce,</hi>

Come then, come forth, O my dull conjealed heart! thou that ſpendeſt thy days in ſorrow, and thy breath in ſighing, that mingleſt thy bread with tears, and drinkeſt the tears which thou weepeſt; thou that prayeſt for joy, and waiteſt for joy, and longeſt for joy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt for want of joy; O the times a coming, when thou ſhalt have fulneſs of joy; the times a coming when the Angels ſhall bring thee to Chriſt, and when Chriſt ſhall take thee by the hand, and lead thee into his purchaſed joy, and preſent thee unſpotted before his Father, and give thee thy place about his Throne; and doſt thou not rejoyce in this: art thou not exceedingly raiſed in ſuch a Meditation as this? ſurely if one drop of lively faith were but mixed with theſe motives, thou mighteſt carry an Heaven within thee, and go on ever ſinging to thy grave; ſay then, doſt thou believe? or doſt thou not believe? if thy faith be firm, how ſhould'ſt thou but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce? if thou rolleſt thy ſelf on Chriſt, and on that promiſe, <hi>I will ſee you again, and

                  <p n="9">9. LET us <hi>conform to Jeſus,</hi> as coming again to judge the World. <hi>Looking to Jeſus</hi> contains this; when the Apoſtle would perſwade Chriſtians to patience under the croſs, he lays down firſt the cloud of witneſſes, all the Martyrs of the Church of Chriſt; and ſecondly Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, as of more vertue and power than all the reſt; the Martyrs ſuffered much, but Chriſt endured more than they all; and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> 
                     <hi>look unto Jeſus;</hi> ſurely he is the beſt exemplar, the chief pattern to whom in all his tranſactions, we may in ſome way or other conform.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhould we conform to Chriſt in this reſpect? I Anſwer—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt will in his time prepare for judgment; Oh let us at all times prepare for his judging of us; doth it not concern us to prepare for him, as well as it concerns him to prepare for us? if Chriſt come, and find us careleſs, negligent, unprepared, what will become of us? the very thought of Chriſt's ſudden coming to judgment might well put us into a waiting, watching poſture, that we might be ſtill in readineſs; it cannot be long, and alas, what is a little time when it is gone; how quickly ſhall we be in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and our ſouls receive their particular judgments; and ſo wait till our bodies be raiſed, and judged to the ſame condition, or ſalvation? it is not an hundred years in all likelyhood, till every ſoul of us ſhall be in heaven or hell; it may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year, or two, or ten, or thereabouts, the greateſt part of this congregation will
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:94897:279"/> be in Heaven or Hell; and I beſeech you what is a year, or two, or ten? what is an hundred, or a thouſand years to the dayes of eternity? how ſpeedily is this gone? and how endleſs is that time, or eternity that is come? is it not high time then to prepare our lamps, to trim our ſouls, to watch, and faſt, and pray, and meditate, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that for all our deeds, good or evill, God will bring us to Judgment? herein is our Conformity to Chriſt's coming; before he comes he prepares for us, oh let us againſt his coming prepare for him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt at his coming will ſummon all his Saints to ariſe, to aſcend, and to come to him in the clouds; O let us ſummon our ſouls to ariſe, to aſcend, and to go to Chriſt in the Heavens. What Chriſt will do really at that day, let us do ſpiritually on this day. It was the prodigal's ſaying, <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my Father, and ſay unto him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 15.18.</note> We are naturally ſluggiſh, we lye in a bed of ſin, and ſecurity; and we are loath to ariſe, to aſcend, and to go to God. Oh then let us call upon our own ſouls! <hi>Awake, awake Deborah! why art thou ſo heavy O my ſoul?</hi> let us ſtir up our ſpirits, conſciences, wills, affections every day; let us wind them up, as a man doth his Watch, that it may be in a continual motion. Alas! alas! we had need to be continually ſtirring up the gifts and graces that are in us; it is the Lords pleaſure that we ſhould daily come to him, he would have us on the wing of Prayer, and on the wing of Meditation, and on the wing of Faith; he would have us to be ſtill ariſing, aſcending and mounting up in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine contemplation to his Majeſty. And is it not our duty, and the Saints diſpoſition to be thus? <hi>Whetherſoever the dead carcaſs is, thither will the Eagles reſort:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 24.28.</note> if Chriſt be in Heaven, where ſhould we be but in Heaven with him? <hi>For where your Treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo.</hi> Oh that every morning, and every evening, at leaſt, our hearts would ariſe, aſcend, and go to Chriſt in the Heavens.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt will at laſt judge all our ſouls, and judge all the wicked to eternal flames; oh let us judge our ſelves, that we may not be judged of the Lord in that ſad Judgment. <hi>If we would judge our ſelves</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we ſhould not be judged.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note> Good reaſon we have to conform to Chriſt in this point, or otherwiſe how ſhould we eſcape the judgment of Chriſt at the laſt day? but in what manner ſhould we judge our ſelves? I anſwer— 1. We muſt ſearch out our ſins. 2. We muſt confeſs them before the Lord. 3. We muſt condemn our ſelves, or paſs a ſentence againſt our own ſouls. 4. We muſt plead pardon, and cry mightily to God in Chriſt for the remiſſion of all thoſe ſins whereof we have judged our ſelves, and condemned our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt ſearch out our ſins. <hi>Winnow your ſelves O people, not worthy to be beloved.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zeph. 2.1.</note> There ſhould be a ſtrict ſcrutiny to find out all the prophaneſs of our hearts and lives, all our ſins againſt light, and love, and checks, and vows; <hi>winnow your ſelves.</hi> If you will not, I pronounce to you from the eternal God, that ere long the Lord will come in the Clouds, and then will he open the black Book wherein all your ſins are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; he will ſearch <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with candles, he will come with a Sword in his hand to ſearch out all ſecure ſinners every where, and then will all your ſins be diſcovered to all the World. O that we would prevent this by our ſearch and ſcrutining a forehand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt confeſs our ſins before the Lord; we muſt ſpread them before the Lord as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did his letter; onely in our confeſſions obſerve theſe rules; As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our confeſſion muſt be full of ſorrow,<note place="margin">Pſal. 38.18.</note> 
                     <hi>I will declare my iniquity</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I will be ſorry for my ſin.</hi> His confeſſions were dolorous confeſſions; he felt ſin, and it wrought upon him as an heavy burthen, <hi>They were two heavy for me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> There's nothing in the World can make an heart more heavy, than when it feels the weight and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our confeſſion muſt be a full confeſſion, we muſt pour it out. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſtiles one of his Pſalms, <hi>A prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſalm 102. Preface.</note> 
                     <hi>and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.</hi> We muſt pour out our complaints, as a man poureth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of a Veſſel. <hi>Ariſe, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches, pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord.</hi> Water runs all out of a Veſſel,<note place="margin">Lam. 2.19.</note> when you turn the mouth downward, never a ſpoon-ful will then ſtay behind; ſo ſhould we pour out our hearts before God, (and if it were poſſible) leave not a ſin unconfeſſed, at leaſt for the kinds, if not for the particular ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our confeſſion muſt be with full aggravation; we ſhould aggravate our ſins by all the circumſtances, that may ſhew them odious. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> when he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Chriſt, it is ſaid that <hi>he thought thereon, and he wept.</hi> He thought thereon,<note place="margin">Matth. 14 72.</note> or he
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:94897:280"/> caſt in his thoughts one thing upon another; <hi>q. d.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was my Maſter and yet I denyed him, he told me of this before-hand, that I might take heed of it, and yet I denyed him; I profeſſed to him that <hi>I</hi> would never do it, I would never forſake him, and yet I denyed him; yea, this very night, and no longer ſince, I ſaid it again and again that I would not deny him, and yet <hi>I</hi> denyed him; yea, <hi>I</hi> fail'd, <hi>Although others deny thee, yet will not I;</hi> and yet worſe than all others, <hi>I</hi> denyed him with a witneſs, for <hi>I</hi> affirmed deſperately that <hi>I</hi> knew not the man; nay, <hi>I</hi> ſware deſperately that <hi>I</hi> knew not the man; nay more than ſo, <hi>I</hi> ſware, and I curſed too, <hi>If I knew the man, let Gods curſe fall upon me;</hi> and all this I did within a few ſtrides of my Lord; at that very time when I ſhould have ſtood for my Lord, in that all the World forſook him; why, theſe were the circumſtances of <hi>Peters</hi> ſin, and meditating on them, <hi>He went out and wept bitterly.</hi> And thus we ſhould aggravate our ſins in our confeſſions; O my ſins were out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſinful. O they were ſins againſt knowledg, and light, againſt many mercies recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, againſt many judgments threatned, againſt many checks of conſcience, againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vows and promiſes; thus oft, and in this place, and at that time, and in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I committed theſe and theſe ſins; but of all the aggravations, let us be ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how we ſinned againſt the goodneſs, and patience, and love, and mercy of God; ſurely theſe circumſtances will make our ſins out of meaſure ſinful. The Angel that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Bochim,</hi> after the repetition of his mercies towards them,<note place="margin">Judges. 2.2.</note> and of their ſins againſt him, he queſtions them in theſe words, <hi>Oh why have ye done this?</hi> q. d. The Lord hath done thus and thus mercifully unto you, oh why have ye done thus unthankfully towards him? why was his mercy abuſed, his goodneſs ſlighted, his patience deſpiſed? do ye thus requite the Lord O fooliſh people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? in like manner ſhould we confeſs and aggravate our ſins, <hi>O my God, thou art my Father; was I ever in want, and thou didſt not relieve me? was I ever in weakneſs, and thou didſt not ſtrengthen me? was I ever in ſtraits, and thou didſt not deliver me? was I ever in ſickneſs, and thou didſt not cure me? was I ever in miſery, and thou didſt not ſuccor me? haſt thou not been a gracious God to me? all my bones can ſay, who is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; Lord, who is like unto thee? and ſhall I thus and thus reward the Lord for all his mercies towards me? hear O Heavens, and hearken O Earth; Sun ſtand thou ſtill, and thou Moon be thou amazed at this! hear Angels, and hear Devils; hear Heaven, and hear Hell, and be you avenged on ſuch a ſin as this is! O the ſinfulneſs of my ſin in regard of theſe many circumſtances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt condemn our ſelves, or paſs ſentence againſt our own ſouls; <hi>Lord, the worſt place in Hell is too good for me; Lord here is my ſoul, thou mayſt if thou pleaſeſt ſend Satan for it, and give me a portion among the damned.</hi> This ſelf-judging, or ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning is exemplified to this life in <hi>Ezra;</hi> for—</p>

                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note>2. <hi>He ſpread out his hands unto the Lord; q. d.</hi> here is my breaſt, and here is my heart-blood, I ſpread my arms, and lay all open, that thou mayſt ſet the naked point of thy ſword of juſtice at my very heart.</p>

He is dum, and ſpeechleſs (as it were) before the Lord; <hi>And now our God, what ſhall we ſay after all this? for we have forſaken thy commandments; q. d.</hi> ſhall I excuſe the matter? alas! it is inexcuſable? what ſhall we ſay after all this? ſhall we call for thy patience? we have had it, but how did we abuſe it? ſhould we call for mercy? indeed we had it, but our ſtubborn hearts would never come down: O our God what ſhall we ſay? I know not what to ſay, for we have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He layes down his ſoul, and all the Peoples ſouls at God's feet, <hi>q. d.</hi> here we are,<note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> thou mayeſt damn us if thou wilt, <hi>Behold we are all here before thee in our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, for we cannot ſtand before thee, becauſe of this.</hi> Behold here we are, rebels we are; here are our heads and throats before the naked point of thy vengeance, if now thou ſhouldſt take us from our knees, and throw us into Hell, if we muſt go from our prayers to damnation, we cannot but ſay that thou art juſt and righteous; Oh its mercy, its mercy indeed that we have been ſpared, its juſt and righteous with God that we ſhould be damned.</p>
                  <pb n="641" facs="tcp:94897:280"/>
                  <p>In this more eſpecially lyes ſelf-condemnation; it makes a man to trample upon his own ſelf, it makes a man freely to accept of damnation;<note place="margin">Levit. 26.41, 42.</note> 
                     <hi>They ſhall accept of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iniquity, and then will I remember my covenant with Jacob;</hi> they ſave God (as it were) a labour, judging themſelves, that they may not be judged.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt plead pardon, and cry mightily to God in Chriſt, for the remiſſion of all our ſins. This is the way of judging our ſelves, we ſee nothing but Hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in our ſelves, but then we fling down our ſelves at God's gate of mercy; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair not in God, though in our ſelves; God in Chriſt is gracious and merciful, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin; and hence we make bold to intreat the Lord for Chriſt's ſake to be merciful to us; ſurely herein lies the difference betwixt nature and grace; the natural man may ſee his ſins, and confeſs his ſins, and judge himſelf for his ſins; thus <hi>Saul</hi> did, and thus <hi>Judas</hi> did, but then they deſpaired in God, and were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned indeed; now the gracious man hath a conſcience within, that repreſents to him his damned eſtate, but withal, it repreſents to him the free grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo he onely deſpairs in himſelf, and not in his God; now thus far good: come Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans! do we deſpair in our ſelves? do we fling off all our own hopes, and our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies, hangings, holdings on duties, purpoſes, graces, performances? and do we go to God in Chriſt, and tell him, <hi>We hang upon nothing but the mere mercy, the free grace of God in Chriſt; and therefore Lord pardon, Lord forgive for thy Names ſake, promiſe ſake, mercies ſake, and for the Lord Jeſus ſake: O let free grace have his work; Lord glorifie thy Name, and glorifie the riches of thy grace in ſaving us:</hi> Why, this is the beſt hold in the World, though the World cannot abide it; ſurely <hi>if we thus judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt at his coming will be glorified in his Saints; not onely in himſelf, but in his Saints alſo; whoſe glory as it comes from him, ſo it will redound to him: Oh let him now be glorified in us, let us now in ſome high way conform to the image of his glory, let us look on Chriſt till we are like Chriſt, not onely in grace, but in glory; and this glory as it comes from him, ſo let it redound to him. I will not ſay, that the Kingdom of Heaven and glory is in this life, I leave this opinion to the dreamers of this time, I mean to the Familiſts, Quakers, and ſuch like; but this I ſay, that even in this life the Saints of God enjoy a begun and imperfect conformity to Chriſt's glory; and this is that I would now preſs upon us; let us ſo <hi>behold the glory of the Lord in the glaſs of the Goſpel,</hi>

                     <hi>that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. And theſe things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. And ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full. And rejoyce with Jeruſalem, and be glad with her all ye that love her,—that ye may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breſts of her conſolations, that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</hi>

But how is a Saint in this life filled with all joy? I anſwer, 1. In regard of the obiect, God and Chriſt. 2. In regard of the degrees; though not abſolutely, yet ſo far forth, as the meaſure of ioy is in this life attainable; I might inſtance in the joy of Mr. <hi>Peacock,</hi> Mrs <hi>Brettergh,</hi> and of ſome Martyrs, who ſung in the fires. 3. In regard of duration, <hi>rejoyce always,</hi>

                  <p>O that ſomething of the glory of Chriſt might reſt upon us! oh that having this glory of Chriſt in our thoughts, we could now feel a change from glory to glory! Is it ſo that the Lord Jeſus will be glorified in all his Saints? and ſhall we have in-glorious ſouls; baſe and unworthy affections and converſations? or ſhall we content our ſelves with a little meaſure of grace? O be we holy, even as he is holy; let our converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be heavenly, let us purifie our ſelves even as he is pure; let us reſemble him in ſome high meaſure of grace. And laſtly, let us glorifie him in bodies and ſpirits; all our glory is from him; and therefore let all our glory redound to him; let us now begin that Goſpel-tune of the eternal ſong of free grace, which one day we ſhall more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chant in glory; <hi>Allelujah! and again Allelujah! and Amen Allelujah! ſalvation, and glory, and power, and praiſe, and thanksgiving, and obedience, be unto him that ſits on the throne, the Lamb bleſſed for ever and ever, Amen.</hi>

                  <head>The Concluſion.</head>
                  <p>And now (my brethren) I have done the errand which Chriſt ſent me on, I verily believe, I have now delivered this work of the everlaſting Goſpel, or of Chriſt's carrying on the great work of man's ſalvation, hath been ſomewhat long in ſpeaking, but oh how long in acting! may I give you a ſhort view of what I have ſaid; and of what hath been acted from eternity, and will yet be acted to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; you may remember, that God in his eternity laid a plot or deſign to glorifie the riches of his grace in ſaving ſinners; and to that purpoſe firſt he decreed a Chriſt. 2. Preſently after the fall, he promiſed the Chriſt he had decreed. 3. In fulneſs of time he exhibited the Chriſt that he had promiſed; then it was that the ſame Chriſt took upon him out nature, and joyned it to his God-head to be one perſon; and in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was born, and lived, and died, and roſe again, and aſcended into Heaven; there now he hath been ſitting, ſending down the Holy Ghoſt, and interceding for his Saints for above one thouſand ſix hundred years: And in this laſt work he will continue till the end of the World, and then he will come again to judge the World, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Saints to himſelf, that where he is, they may be with him, to ſee and enjoy him to all eternity. This is the epitome of all I have ſaid; onely in every particular I have ſet down Chriſt's actings towards us, and our actings towards Chriſt; in various formes, and out-goings of his love he hath acted towards us; and in various formes, and out-goings of our ſouls we have been taught fitly and ſuitably to act towards him.</p>
                  <p>Now in all theſe actings, How doth the free grace of God in Chriſt appear? <hi>Ye are ſaved by grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.5.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. the decree, the means, the end of our ſalvation is grace, and onely grace. The decree is grace, and therefore it is called <hi>the election of grace;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.5. 2 Tim. 1.9. Rom. 3.24. Rom. 6.23. Eph. 1.7. Eph. 2.7.</note> the means are of grace, and therefore <hi>we are called according to his grace;</hi> and <hi>we are juſtified freely by his grace.</hi> And the end is of grace, for <hi>eternal life is the gift of God,</hi> both beginning, and progreſs, and execution is all of grace. This is <hi>the riches of his grace, the exceeding, the hyperbolical riches of his grace;</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all is this, God's free grace which was firſt deſigned, will at laſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and eternally praiſed by Saints and Angels; the ſame free grace which from the beginning of the age of God, from everlaſting drove on the ſaving plot, and ſweet deſign of our ſalvation, will at laſt be glorified to purpoſe; when Heavens inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants will be ever digging into this golden-mine; ever rolling this ſoul-delighting and precious ſtone; ever beholding, viewing, enquiring, and ſearching into the excellency of this ſame Chriſt, and this free grace. Now all is done, ſhall I ſpeak a word for Chriſt, or rather for our ſelves in relation to Chriſt; and ſo an end? if I had but one word more to ſpeak in the World, it ſhould be this; Oh let all our ſpirits be taken up with Chriſt! let us not buſie our ſelves too much with toyes, or trifles, with ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and low things, but <hi>look unto Jeſus.</hi> Surely Chriſt is enough to fill all our thoughts, deſires, hopes, loves, joys, or whatever is within us, or without us; Chriſt alone comprehends all the circumference of all our happineſs; Chriſt is the pearl hid in the large field of God's Word; Chriſt is the ſcope of all the Scriptures; all things and perſons in the old World were Tipes of him; all the Prophets foretold him, all God's love runs through him, all the gifts and graces of the Spirit flow from him, the whole eye of God is upon him, and all his deſigns both in Heaven and Earth meet in him;<note place="margin">Eph. 1.10.</note> the great deſign of God is this, <hi>That he might gather together in one all
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:94897:281"/> things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</hi> All things are ſummed up in one Jeſus Chriſt; if we look on the creation, the whole world was made by Chriſt, if we look on providences, all things ſubſiſt in Chriſt, they have their being, and their well-being in him. Where may we find God but in Chriſt? where may we ſee God but in this eſſential and eternal glaſs?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6. Heb. 1.3.</note> Chriſt is <hi>the face of God, the brightneſs of his glory, the expreſs image of his Fathers perſon;</hi> the Father is as it were all Sun, and all Pearl; and Jeſus Chriſt is the ſubſtantial rayes, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and eſſential irradiation of this Sun of glory: Chriſt outs God as the ſeal doth the ſtamp; Chriſt reveals God, as the face of a man doth reveal the man; ſo Chriſt to <hi>Philip, He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father; q. d.</hi> I am as like the Father,<note place="margin">John 14.9.</note> as God is like himſelf; there is a perfect indiviſible unity between the Father and me, <hi>I and the Father are one;</hi> one very God, he the begetter, and I the begotten; Chriſt is the ſubſtantial Roſe that grew out of the Father from eternity; Chriſt is the eſſential wiſdom of God; Chriſt is the ſubſtantial Word of God, the intellectual birth of the Lord's infinite underſtanding. Oh the worth of Chriſt! compare we other things with Chriſt, and they will bear no weight at all; caſt into the ballance with him An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they are wiſe, but he is wiſdom; caſt into the ballance with him men, they are lyars, lighter than vanity, but Chriſt is <hi>the Amen, the faithful witneſs;</hi> caſt into the ſcales Kings, and all Kings, and all their glory, why he is King of Kings; caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſcale millions of tallents-weight of glory; caſt in two Worlds, and add to the weight, millions of Heavens of Heavens, and the ballance cannot down, the ſcales are unequal, Chriſt out-weighs all. Shall I yet come nearer home? what is Heaven but to be with Chriſt; what is life eternal but to believe in God, and in his Son Jeſus Chriſt? where may we find peace with God, and reconciliation with God, but onely in Chriſt; <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> where may we find compaſſion, mercy, and gentleneſs to ſinners, but onely in Chriſt? it is Chriſt that takes off infinite wrath, and ſatisfies juſtice, and ſo God is a moſt lovely, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, deſirable God in Jeſus; all the goodneſs of God comes out of God through this golden pipe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: It is true, thoſe eſſential attributes of love, grace, mercy, goodneſs, are onely in God, and they abide in God, yet the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manifeſtation of love, grace, mercy, and goodneſs, is onely in Chriſt; Chriſt alone is the Treaſury, Store-houſe, Magazene of the free goodneſs and mercy of the God-head. In him we are Elected, Adopted, Redeemed, Juſtified, Sanctified, Saved; he is the ladder, and every ſtep of it betwixt Heaven and Earth; he is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life;</hi> he is honour, riches, beauty, health, peace, and ſalvation; he is a ſuitable and rich portion to every man's ſoul; that which ſome of the Jews obſerve of the Mannah, that it was in taſte according to every man's pallate, it is really true of Chriſt, that he is to the Soul whatſoever the ſoul would have him to be. All the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſings wherewith we are enriched, are in and by Chriſt: God hears our prayers by Chriſt; God forgives our iniquities through Chriſt; all we have, and all we expect to have, hangs onely on Chriſt; he is the golden hinge, upon which all our ſalvation turns.</p>
                  <p>Oh how ſhould all hearts be taken with this Chriſt? Chriſtians, turn your eyes upon the Lord; <hi>Look, and look again unto Jeſus:</hi> Why ſtand ye gazing on the toyes of this World, when ſuch a Chriſt is offered to you in the Goſpel? can the World dye for you? can the World reconcile you to the Father? can the World advance you to the Kingdom of Heaven? As Chriſt is <hi>all in all,</hi> ſo let him be the full and compleat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our deſire, and hope, and faith, and love, and joy; let him be in your thoughts the firſt in the morning, and the laſt at night. Shall I ſpeak one word more to thee that believeſt? Oh apply in particular all the tranſactions of Jeſus Chriſt to thy very ſelf; remember how he came out of his Fathers boſom for thee, wept for thee, bled for thee, poured out his life for thee, is now riſen for thee, gone to Heaven for thee, ſits at God's right hand, and rules all the World for thee; makes interceſſion for thee, and at the end of the World will come again for thee, and receive thee to himſelf, to live with him for ever and ever. Surely if thus thou believeſt, and liveſt; thy life is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and thy death will be ſweet; if there be any Heaven upon Earth, thou wilt find it in the practiſe, and exerciſe of this Goſpel-duty, in <hi>Looking unto Jeſus.</hi>
